WSB - Posted @2022-08-10 23:56:16 - I think it may be easiest to demonstrate this by sharing my tactical chart which I use for establishing my short term positions. It's a little busy, but I think it spells out the value and answers u/ErectoPeentrounus question.

[https://imgur.com/a/86qi1OY](https://imgur.com/a/86qi1OY)

This is a little noisy, but the pitchfork tracks the median for the market downtrend, which establishes a 2 standard deviation range for the downtrend. I'm also tracking a trend that the market established in the first two quarters around EMA 8 high touches and OpEx (a pattern which is now broken along with the pitchfork channel).

Note how predictive the initial inverse head and shoulders leading into the March rally was at providing support in the future market trend and how it interacted with the EMA 50 zone.

Typically how you play the EMA 50 is that above the EMA 50 is bullish and below is bearish. If you're trending the market using this, you want to see a test of the EMA 50 and rejection on either side. If you don't get that, you can get a breakdown of the price action like we did in April, and that does correlate with the volume trend.

The volume chart confirms u/zyzzonomics observation that volume is still down, and as we can see from the moving average, during the bear market there is a correlation with the volume trend and downslopes, which makes sense because in a bear market, buys are suppressed but selling volume dominates. 

The problem is this is backward looking and the question really is ""does the decline in volume presage a decline?""

The answer is.. it could, but it doesn't have to. We'll get to a historical example in a second.

But there are several key points, particularly in the first three months, where it looked like a positive volume trend with a positive correlation with market movement, like in March, and this faked a lot of people out.

Now look at the OBV chart, which I've done some trending on over time. That big thick red line is the main volume/price decline trend **starting in December.**

Note that OBV begins declining **while the market is still going up.**

This is a perfect example of volume/price relationship divergence. What OBV is telling us here is that the behavior of the market is changing, and it tells us this BEFORE the price action changes (although if you were using the EMA or SMMA matrix set, you can see the change in behavior there, too).

It's not necessarily bullish or bearish, but it represents a potential change in how the market trades. Just like these resistance lines, during a bullish run OBV will typically correlate well with the price action, meaning that it will respect support levels. Volume in the market during bull runs is predictable to some extent because people remain engaged.

So what we're really looking for here is places where what the chart is telling us might be wrong.

Enter the March rally. That big OBV downtrend line was much higher than the indicator was at... and that indicator, on the day of the rally, broke a smaller (dashed yellow line) sub-trend (remember, we can establish a trendline with 3 touches). 

Now look at whenever OBV passes these resistance trends and breaks them: Something violent happens in the market when it passes. That's OBV detecting the change in behavior.

If you were trading the March rally and just looking at EMA 50 and volume, a person could be forgiven for overleveraging long following those tactical rules, but what happened when OBV hit the already-established main trendline? The rally died.

Literally on the day that it touched that trendline. It's like it touched the third rail on a subway.

It respects that line all the way down until May 2nd, and what happens then? SPY gains 20 pts in 3 days into the Fed meeting. (This gets killed by a combination of things, including bad earnings and declarations of coming recession by European banks).

(Or did it? See the 3-touch EMA 8 pattern and the trade down to OpEx pattern. I don't actually have a solid answer for which is the cause... probably both.)

We trade back down, then break again and what happens? SPY rallies from 390 to 415 within a week starting May 25th roughly.

The big downtrend is now a median line, and we have a new upper minor short term downtrend established. 

But OBV also establishes support levels which correlate with support in the price action. These also represent violent declines and bounces. A break down from support in the price action will often come with a change of supported volume to the downside, meaning that what you're really tracking here, between the diagonal trends and the support/resistance levels is...

...triangles.

Triangles in the market are decision moments. They're not directional predictably and can break in either direction, but when you get to the end of a triangle the market has to decide if it's adhering to a downtrend or support, and which way it moves will show the volume/price trend change as it happens.

The red support line at the very bottom is the recovery support level from 2020. There's a minor relationship between prior support levels in prior declines and crash levels, but it's not hardset. 

When did we begin the climb to out of the down channel? On the same fuckin' day the OBV trend tested the 2020 crash recovery verification support OBV trend. ROFL

Tell me that's not fuckin' weird.

See, we don't really have a new trend until the double bottom on June 30th and July 14th. After that we start generating higher highs and higher lows, and when does that finally break and the market stop ranging sideways?

On the exact day that the OBV trend hits the triangle formed by the support level and the Bear market downward trend, and it really starts rallying when it breaks that other downtrend. 

How you use OBV is to confirm the price action and trending in the chart. It's an additive indicator. You can play it. These support points are often good places to gamble on taking leveraged positions, but just like a normal market trendline, just because it exists doesn't mean it'll be respected, so the play is really on breaks that confirm with other trend changes, like channel breaks and other algorithmically played chart structures (like the smaller inverse head and shoulders and the channel break on the day of the Fed March meeting). When you get a bunch of these lined up at once and they confirm, that's your safest entry point for a new position because the next few days are commonly (not always) somewhat violent.

What happened today? Well, CPI was obviously a huge factor, but we touched the new minor downtrend at close yesterday, and bounced right off of it. Now what we're looking for is for it to test a horizontal resistance line and possibly form an upward trend. That should be another violent movement. 

So if we look at this as behavioral changes and the prior OBV trend was Bearish but we're flattening out in the relationship, that's just like a ranging market, it can technically go either way (hence my statement that the chart is mixed... we don't have bull run confirmation and OBV has been ranging) but if we're changing behavior, now we have to be ready for a potential directional change up, and that will build momentum and eventually has to test the resistance horizontals... if it doesn't, the rally will die off and decline.

You do see this happen in long corrections, crashes, so it can step up then back down. It did this in 2007-2008 at least once, but that did correlation with month+ long extreme rallies.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-11 00:46:16 - Fed swaps this morning absolutely destroyed the VIX, yet SPY didn't rally much higher than the algo morning pump, looks like its the same deal of retail and algos doing all the buying. This bear market rally is now reaching historical high off the low at greater than 15% for SPY. You'd only see these kind of extreme rallies in brutal bear markets like the dotcom and 2008 crash. Just adds more to my thoughts that this bear market will be long and brutal with this kind of behavior. 


Take a look at the below chart, think it's very interesting. Looking at bear market rallies in terms of drawdown retracements (after the initial 20% decline), shows that it's uncommon to retrace more than 50% of the decline and then go back down to new lows. None since WWII, but 60%, 80%, and 90% retacements in the 1930s bear markets

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FZ0Ai6lWYAANgXd?format=jpg&name=4096x4096

Shows how 420 is an absolute landmark here. We cross above this, either we really are in a new bull market (strong doubt in the beginning of a fed tightening cycle amidst global recession) OR we are going to have a very ugly downturn in October.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-11 01:51:51 - Yeah this may turn out to be the oddest bear market in all of history. Must be the pavlovian QE low interest conditioning of the last two decades triggering the algos and retail to buy the dip no matter what.

 
It's also interesting to note how the 10 year yield crashed this morning on the inflation report, but then went all the way back up and regained all the loss. Equities completely unchanged. I also remember the last few weeks how the treasury market completely did a 180 after the fed jawboned pushing back against a pivot, but once again, stocks unchanged. 

The stock market is completely detached from all reality at this point, detached from fundamentals and the bond market. China could invade Taiwan and this shit could pump to 500 it seems.

All I know is that ALWAYS the stock market ponzi scheme comes back to the fundamentals and snaps back to reality at some point. SPY no different than BBBY at this point, pumping endlessly but eventually the musical chairs ends. But who knows, maybe this will be the first time in history it doesn't üòÇüòÇüòÇ

WSB - Posted @2022-08-11 02:07:43 - I'd start with learning some technical analysis on YouTube. So you can try to get better at predicting $SPY price movements. And set up iron corridors starting 2 weeks out, then every week set another 2 weeks out. Asses your predictions in an excel document try to see if your predictions are good and once you have 80% consistency decide if you want to start adding a little more funds. Never put all your money on one contract, good deals on multi leg contracts do not mean people will buy them. Set stop losses and understand you need to pick stocks with high trading volume.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-11 11:26:44 - There's actually not that much price volume at SPY 417. If SPY dumps today, I think it'll go to 415. Though that's a big if I guess.
__________________________","WSB - Posted @2022-08-11 12:52:27 - Fair enough dude, I'm just extra pissed off today, so seeing red atm (ironic, cause its all Green).

But I wasn't buying from 480 though, I'd waited patiently for 450, then 420, then 380. All the while being patient, not jumping the gun, waiting for an 8-10% further drop. But at each of those levels it seemed reasonable for it to reverse, so id go long, but it just kept falling. 

I'm not greedy, I try to be patient and thoughtful and manage risk and all that. But SPY straight up 20% in just a couple weeks, is simply outrageous.

__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-12 00:37:01 - It depends on the stock, unfortunately. They're all influenced by the indexes on some level, since there's parity and ETF membership consideration at play, but whether they move with the market depends a lot on where the flows are.

What you want to do is look at the stock in question and see if there's some degree of correlation with market movement and conditions, and then consider whether or not the stock is overall beating the market or not.

If you find some correlation and the stock moves down 0.25% on average but the market in a given move goes down 0.50%, for example, but then one the move up the stock elevates with it or higher, the net result of the parity flow will often (not always, again depends on the flow) be to multiply the movement on the meme stock since it compounds.

Looking at BBBY's chart, we don't have a case for strong parity in movement, since the chart does not reflect the macro index charts for SPY or QQQ, but the two peaks this year correspond with big movements in those indexes, in March and now, meaning that the exposure to the market is largely from supporting bullish trends and capital flows.

Watching today I can say for a fact that index flow redirection also reflected in BBBY's price action, with today's peak being at 10:20 Eastern. So I would expect BBBY to be influenced by the larger market trend, yes.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-12 00:34:06 - Tomorrow SPY ends under 420. MMs arent stupid so unlike most of you, they wont lose money.
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-12 00:25:41 - CHWY has a supporting structure that could, if it can break existing resistance at the 200 day smoothed moving average around $52 take it up as high as the 55-65 range depending on how the market moves. 

A slightly risky play since if the market declines with SPY hitting the 420 mark, which is the old neckline trend from the August-January 2021 head and shoulders, the stock could deflate if small caps and risky growth deleverage. But a conducive market should allow it to beat that given the on balance volume trending demonstrating strength trending which is somewhat beating the market. With established recent support at the 50 day smoothed moving average around $38, the downside risk here isn't that bad. A share play may be smart, but I'm degenerate so I'm holding some options. 

There ya go, now you have animal knowledge and a stock tip. :)

WSB - Posted @2022-08-12 18:40:40 - That's one way, but you can get tradeable double or triple tops before falling back to support... it just actually has to be one. I guarantee that some of the people on here who were saying SPY triple-topped were bought puts and were really surprised when it burned past 425 because it was actually a consolidation pattern.

I think it's hilarious that people are making these astrology claims on here, but right after I posted this SPY did exactly what I suggested it'd do.

__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-12 18:20:45 - More like no sellers around. Since ‚Äò09 low volume rallies have been the norm, especially in ETFs, SPY and VOO. One theory is that volume is more dispersed around products.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-12 18:17:17 - Daily RSI on SPY has been under 70 since November last year, it just hit 70 today. So idk who's been telling you it's over 70 for the last 2 months but that is incorrect. Also I'm 100% long rn anyways.

Then I F‚Äôd up hard by selling a put credit spread $420/$417 exp 8/12 during the peak on Thursday. Then SPY tanked the rest of the day, down to $419üò®üò®üò®. My account went from $300k to $190k in a few hours. I thought hard about selling on EOD Thursday, but then just heldüíéüíéüíé. Today‚Äôs market rally saved me‚Ä¶ (35k profit.üíµ)

WSB - Posted @2022-08-12 20:52:44 - Phenomenal performance OP! But you should have been doing this on XSP instead of SPY. It‚Äôs the exact same economic outcome, but XSP is considered a 1256 contract whereas SPY is just regular stock. All your gains will be taxed as ordinary income (short-term cap gains). If you had used XSP, 60% of your gains would have been taxed at long-term capital gains rates with the other 40% taxed as short-term capital gains. That‚Äôs the regulatory tax treatment of 1256 contracts, even on day trades. You could save yourself as much as 17% on taxes (assuming highest marginal rate) if you use XSP instead of SPY.

The score so far: üêª 85-69 üêÆ (nice)

Counting >1% movements: üêª 37-38 üêÆ (bulls ahead!!!)

Counting >2% movements: üêª 14-15 üêÆ (bulls ahead!!!)

Months: üêª 4-2 üêÆ (May was flat)

Weeks: üêª 19-13 üêÆ 

Last 4 weeks: üêª 0-4 üêÆ (a first this year)

SPY made 68 new highs last year vs. 1 this year so far. 97 trading days left to go in 2022. Stay tuned for tomorrow's episode of Bulls vs. Bears to see who is fuk tomorrow.

Fun fact: This is the first time we had 4 green weeks in a row since October (10 months ago).

Fun fact 2: We haven't had a -1% day since July 15th and we haven't had a -2% day since June 28th.

Fun fact 3: We've had 7 red days in the last 10 days but SPY still climbed nearly 4% during this time.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-12 23:53:33 - Some things to add:

SPY trades until 4:15 pm. Less volume and easier to move prices. Because of this, you want to close out your positions and not let them expire worthless.

And finally, what happens if SPY closes under $420, but over $417. The short put is in the money, but your long put expires worthless. You would need $46,872,000 to cover the shares (1,116 contracts of $420 puts). Now the loss is not so defined. That's why you should close positions. Imagine if SPY was $422 at 4:00 pm, but ends below $420 at 4:15 pm.

Also I skimmed through so might have missed it but with OPEX next week I think we will be flat/kangaroo this week and maybe the following week we get another rally into the 430s on SPY I just don't see Spy getting over 430 nor do I see it getting below 418 this upcoming week. My tin foil guess is that we are indeed extending past a bear rally and are pricing somthing in whether good or bad, that all tied up with midterms around the corner  Sep-Oct will be the most unknown imo. Lots of deep(<400) Put OI all the way to mid Sept but good to see your posts again. I hedged a bit weird for next week so we shall see.

__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-13 12:49:16 - You should only be long on options if you know a big event is about to happen. I dabbled with options for years trying to do everything from LEAPS to holding and selling for only a few minutes at a time. My conclusion after losing thousands? Holding long options is for muppets. I didn‚Äôt start consistently making money until I was a net seller of options and allowed time value decay to put premium in my pocket. 
Example of the one time to be long: I bought 1000 SPY put options way out of the money  (I think price was around $0.10/ contract) in late February 2020 when I saw that Covid was coming to our shores. I made $400+k by the end of March. I took $200k of that and bought another 1000 put contracts, figuring that the market wasn‚Äôt done crashing yet, I figured I was going to net around $4 million if the market went down another 15 %. Shortly after, Trump announced stimulus, and that $200k evaporated. I was still ahead, but the gains weren‚Äôt exactly ‚Äòfuck you‚Äô money.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-13 14:28:33 - If I had to guess people are rebalancing their capital into less risk. Like for funds VTI has a little more risk than SPY because of the 15 % small caps, and big blue chips like Apple might have a little less risk/volatility than SPY, at least if you make a portfolio of them. I read (well, heard on audio book) the little book that beats the market earlier this year, and he recommended making a portfolio of 30 value stocks that'd beat the S&P500. I'm always a bit sceptical about easy life hacks like that, but I think he made a good point, diversifying into 30 carefully selected value stocks would probably be better than going into a broad index fund. I think he beat the index with like 9 percent annually or something, I don't remember exactly.

When I enter the market again, I'll probably buy some individual blue chips like Apple in addition since I've seen how well it's been going now, and also because you have commission free trading for stocks now and can avoid the 0.03 yearly commision in VOO and VTI though it isn't much. Some of the tech stocks will probably recover quickly too, but at least Apple seems like free money so I think I'll stick to it. I've read a bit about growth stocks and want to invest in them too after the bear market rally is over, I have one in Norway (a flight company) I think we'll rocket, but finding these companies are hard I think. Will probably try to check out some in the trash bin thread here on wsb, but I'm always a bit afraid that people here are trying to trick you into a pump and dump to be honest. They did that a lot before GME apparently before they added rule 3 and 4, though that was before my time here.

__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-13 17:42:41 - They sell put vertical spreads and price the strike prices low so that it is unlikely to hit. They collect a lower premium, but risk losing more if it does drop below their strike prices.

In the OP's example, SPY opened around $416 on Monday. He sold a 408/405 put vertical spread: selling $408 puts at 1.48 and buy $405 puts at 0.98, collecting a total of 0.50 per contract at a risk of losing 3.00 per contract. He sold 1,008 contracts.

He collects the full premium if it expires worthless: $50,400 (1,008 x $50), but risks losing $252,000 [($302,000 (full loss) - $50,400 (premium collected)]. In his case, SPY would have to drop 2% from the current price by expiration.

It works until it doesn't. Some people price the strike prices even lower, such as 5% below current price. Maybe they profit weekly for several months until the big sell-off happens and you lose months of gains.

My advice to OP was that the higher SPY goes, the more likely for downside than upside and the higher the risk his trades become. If he wants to continue his strategy, I recommend that he waits for the next big sell-off before trying it again.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-13 17:26:24 - I got wiped out 3 times in my trading career.  
30K to 7K my first year trading penny stocks.  
About 3 years later I turned that 7K to 240K also trading penny stocks, but with a different safer strategy.  
 ( Lesson learned, don't chase penny stocks. Do your DD to catch the rally before it happens )  


The 2nd time I got wiped out was, believe it or not, buying put options on Gamestop last year after the monster run.  
90K to 10K wipe.  
( Lesson learned, don't short or buy puts on meme stocks, the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent )  


I turned that 10K to 110K with a perfectly timed options trade on AMD.  


I lost all of it, 110K to 1K, in a matter of a month after a string of extremely bad luck trading $SPY options.   
( Lesson learned don't be retarded and trade short-dated options on anything, you can be 99% right on the direction and the timing of the trade but that 1% chance can bankrupt you )  


I eventually made it all back and then some with a well timed long-dated options trade on AMD, COIN & NVDA in October of last year.   


Why I'm telling you this.  


1- Great traders ( not talking about me ) often experience prolonged losing streaks when they start out and some get wiped out multiple times before becoming sustainably profitable.   


2- 40K in debt is not too bad, I know this sounds crazy, but it isn't. You will be able to pay it off in a few years ( pay it off as soon as you can ) and you can start again.

3- Learn from what led you to your loss and never repeat that mistake again.

4- Test your strategy with paper-trading before you use real money. 

5- Understand your risk, if you don't understand your risk your losses will be much greater than you are willing to accept. If you understand your risk, you pretty much know how much you can and will likely lose on your trade before taking it and this will help you make better trades and cope with the losses and accept them.

I hope this helps. But don't despair. I've been there before, it's not the end of your trading career. You will recover from this, be patient, use the time to improve your understanding of the market and hone your strategies and skills.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-13 21:48:40 - Realistically? 
This hype train will die out in 6 weeks, and then limbo, see AMC and GME, squeeze was squozen, thinking that GME will moon, at this point makes no sense.
I don't think it was squozen for BBBY yet.
I can see huge gains this week, with the hype train, I'm happy to see spike to 35 and get out in part, maybe 50 if we really fuck up the algorithms, as much fun as it is to see the candles, even DFV reduced his position. 
Cash is cash, buy SPY and Nasdaq til EOY, gamble with some, but not all your money.

EOY 50 USD is possible, but speculative as fuck!

Surely, I don't think we will see single digit price in this stock for a very long time, same with GME and AMC, gorrila is out the cage.

DD with my finest crayon's:

At the moment we are at 13 usd, valued 1 billion.
With 35usd per share, company valuation will be approx 3,2 billion dollars....
As it stands GME and AMC were squeezed to, at this moment, 12 billion in evaluation, and BBBY is just about 1 billion now, see my fucktard way of thinking?
I also refuse to believe that shorts learned their lesson, better yet, they're likely bullish to ride that wave for a week or two, and then they'll exit, which will cause some massive drops.

My valuation math is probably fucked, it's Saturday, so I ain't sober and I'm not doing maths for you, someone will comment below, correcting me.

So yes, I can believe that AMC and GME crowd will jump on the bandwagon and will push the valuation this high, purely out of the mechanism of the market, and to have another GME moment.

Purely momentum, I can see 35 EUR spike this week, and Friday with bunch of options expiring will be fun, for sure.

Mind you, week ago Monday bbby shot up 60% in a single day.
This play was still relatively under the radar for most, this has changed last week, when everyone noticed the spike and started paying attention.
Loads of calls were executed this Friday for strike price 10 - 10,50 
Seeing the posts here, there's a number of options that will expire on the 19th, for the same strike price.

I hit $1.5M last Jan starting with about $200k.  Guess what I am at $260k now.  I lost about $1.2M I was up. Gotta learn when to harvest a good win and put it in something safer or pay off bills.  I kick myself daily for not putting at least $1M in SPY or something else boring.  At one point I had over $650k cash in my accounts as I took a week or two to try to settle nefore I pushed it back in the market.

Take this as a lesson and if you find yourself so fortunate in the future pull some off the table.

__________________________","WSB - Posted @2022-08-14 06:40:09 - Personally, i believe it wont even take direct war or for china to reclaim taiwan for precious metals and other commodities to see a drastic uptick in price. 

The covid clusterfuck and logistics issues that followed are reason enough to give pause to the consumers and pique interest for investors. Within the US we are seeing an increased demand for rare earth/precious metals for industrial use and many of the businesses growing roots back in the US are increasingly choosing to buy local. It saves on shipping and import and more importantly it avoids delays in production.

There needs to be a huge increase in production of rare earth minerals for the US to hit its targets for EVs. With companies like General Motors signing contracts with Mountain Pass and others, with the US government giving allocating millions to this company and billions to others to stimulate national industry.. its a no brainer.  MP is by far the largest rare earth mine in North America.. so it seems like a decent bet.

The largest short term concern is an economic downturn driving demand into the dirt. The long term concern imo is electric cars moving away from motors that require rare earth minerals.. neither of which are of major concern because: govt subsidy and literally every automaker demanding material. 

Im long MP. Its paid off so far. Its beat earnings for six quarters, beats the industry average on margins and sales. traded at a high of over $60 recently (march) on news of govt $$$ and analysts put a price target of $47.90 mean with a high of $60. 

That being said, the stock tracks SPY and it seems to trade with volatility on a downtrend on SPY. Not for the faint of heart.

And even then I was wrong, it‚Äôs 60% taxed at long term cap gains, and 40% taxed at short term cap gains. So this *would* apply to SPY contracts fwiw. But even then it would be better to sell the contract vs convert to shares then sell.

I think everyone expects this to be like 00-02‚Äô and 07-08‚Äô recession and it just May not be. However, all macros points to high risk of more downside and literally no fundamentals point to ATHs or even close this year. Who fucking knows tho, may go full port in ITM $SPY puts

WSB - Posted @2022-08-14 21:10:15 - Interesting points. 

I understand ignorance is bliss, but a sobering statistic that comes out of left field could just as easily restart panic sell process. 

Here are some concerns: 
-Europe is rallying but they‚Äôre at risk of shutting down factories for Winter fueling. 
-Canada‚Äôs ‚Äúsoft landing‚Äù is as subtle as a Highschool nerd flirting to a beautiful cheerleader (its not working). A warning to Jpowel‚Äôs appeoach. 
- The Ukraine war and the numerous drought over the world is going to fuck over food prices everywhere (as it is being priced into CPI) 

The last few days the $SPY volume was lowest in a while. Sure we‚Äôve been in an uptick, but this rally seems to be cautiously moving. With the bond Yield curve inversion deepening, its creating a drag in the markets. 

With the bussiness loans, I 100% agree with you. But remember these bussiness will cut costs to make their green line go up. The cheap loans can give the bussiness excuses to cut corners to reap more profits to themselves. 


I agree we are kicking it down the road, i just wonder if this shit storm will hit sooner than expected.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 12:55:45 - Hi KingDjtar, ok lets talk makro. A while ago I started plotting Fibonacci Retracements to the S&P500 (note it is sketched chart technique not something that is likely to happen. However it sometimes helps to make an educated guess and make a prediction based on probabilities - thats what we do here right?). As german, I'm pessimistic in general. So I do not trust the strong upward momentum we saw in the last months (but Taiwan and recession did also not happen jet. I want to hope it never will). I'd rather like to see it near the green line and deeper to be more sure to place some longs. 

Only looking at the charts, leaving your VIX theory aside (I come to that later), I belive, we have reached a first possible turn around if it dips this week, it could go back to 2.2 SPY 3900 (bear case - right? What do the others think?).

Now having further positive momentum (and looking at the vix you have a point here, in addition we see a price acceptance at the level we are right now, with the vix (I visualized the vix together with S&P500 (vix is relaxed now, not a high volantility and not much fear), it could indeed go higher. However, not easy but next resistance could then be at a level were we were before the correction started - Bull scenario to S&P 4600? What do the others think?

In this scenario I don't know what will happen. Maybe it goes sideways. But please teach me wrong. I'd linke to see a further correction before I take further longs in my longterm portfolio. - seems I can not add the 2 charts here. I'll mail them to you.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 16:27:13 - In regards to the TQQQ trade, I sold out for about $1000 loss around the 155 mark(before the split)....so it wasn't that bad, but enough to learn a lesson.

Tqqq gives better premium...hands down....but you even said yourself, bagholding SPY isn't that bad, and I agree...so worse case, thats what I'll be doing with spy. Im ok with that.

However, just take my Jan 22 TQQQ assignment as an example.  I got assigned around 166 (or 83 post split) and If I didn't sell out at 155 (77.5 post split),  I'd be down around 58% right now.   That potential draw down that exists in TQQQ is just to much for me and my risk tolerance.  My opinion might change when we are DEFINATLY in a bull market, but right now, it just feels like Russian Roulette selling options in TQQQ.

I‚Äôd expect a reversal when we hit the 200 day moving average (430) or when the fed minutes come out on Wednesday which might just happen at the same time. The minutes should reaffirm the feds commitment to keeping rates above neutral until inflation is down to 2%. That should kill the euphoria for some time

__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 22:16:00 - Yeah, I'm pretty new in using it, but I've noticed that it's usually a minute or two ahead of the direction of SPY. Even though I've not done any trades last couple of days, I think it's a pretty good indicator. I don't have access to volspd sadly. I think the set up now looks a bit like the set up in April/May, there was a small fake breakout before the big break out and dump, but I'm unsure if you can use it that way. I'd just guess that algos use VOLD and might continue selling if it continues down after the breakout like in April. Especially since the algos are so strong in a low volume environment like we've experienced last couple of months.

That'll give an idea of where retail is and if inflation continues to slow things down. If the big retailers miss this week and give weak guidance, I believe we'll correct downwards a bit. We're also getting close to the 200 day SMA for SPY. If this is a mere bear market rally, I expect a rejection there if we go that high.

__________________________","WSB - Posted @2022-08-16 05:47:26 - I‚Äôm sitting this one out. I was in SPRT last year and was lucky I got in at 6. My top post is still up from how much I made. 

I‚Äôve been in school focused hard the last few months and just haven‚Äôt been making a move at all and not on the market the way I used to be. I‚Äôve missed out on over $400k this year but not pulling the trigger on SPY so many times. It‚Äôs the only thing I pay  attention. Whenever I do check. 

Last week was my first week scrolling through the usual subs and I was annoyed by how BBBY was flooding everything everyday so I skipped out of Reddit mostly. Save for the veterans benefits thread. 

I won‚Äôt fomo in and I‚Äôm extremely happy for all of you that stayed down and are now financially free or in a much more comfortable position in life. You deserve it. Never let anyone say otherwise. This country is hard on people. Please don‚Äôt blow it chasing big gains. SPY or high dividend stock are many of your best bets. You can make a lot of money not doing anything. Please think about that as you read this. 

On another note, 2yrs of stocks counted down and out, going parabolic thanks to TECHNICAL fundamentals and ortex/Bloomberg terminal access is certainly informative. I hope the people who seriously understand the numbers (like went to school for this stuff) (have generated a significant income consistently via trading) can work together to go through everything from GME to SPRT to IRNT to BBBY and compile all this data into one big informative educational post. And then have the mods post it. A smarter batch of traders would help prevent a loss of money, as well as be able to identify via extensive DD a tighter number of potential big gainers. They could look at ortex/Bloomberg data day by day, month by month. Look at the social media chatter. Company pr. Etc.

__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-16 05:11:59 - Basically, there are patterns of buying and selling in the market that form repeating patterns, with a series of waves up followed by correction waves down. These patterns sometimes repeat depending on the context and the stock in question.

If you look at SPY on the 1Y chart starting from the 2020 crash, there's a pretty good Elliott Wave-like pattern there, with 5 waves separated by notable short declines, followed by 2+ correction waves down. 

The problem with Elliott Wave theory is that the pattern doesn't always repeat perfectly. Sometimes you get 3 waves and 2 corrections, sometimes you get 5 waves and 3 corrections. They don't always have the same proportion, too, so it can be really easy to misread waves and create narratives that don't fit how the stock is actually trading. There are also commonly ranging patterns between wave patterns that can really blow up an Elliott Wave analysis.

Like all forms of technical analysis, a break in the pattern is useful information that should be taken into account and planned for when using the method, but people don't use it that way... they typically use TA to try to form a narrative around what they want the stock to do, and Elliott Wave theory is particularly vulnerable to that kind of thing.

__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-16 12:14:42 - In 100% lock step agreement with you. IMO this is just one giant dead cat bounce off of the 200MA. Especially when you look at previous crashes, it‚Äôs a premature spike bottom, that I don‚Äôt expect to get any Fed follow through. Hasn‚Äôt stopped me from buying back the short leg on my SPY credit spreads and riding this summer rally, though. Like you, I‚Äôve been financing my put spreads with premium from my call spreads. I‚Äôve moved out to Q4 from my Q3 positions on account of this rally, though. 

What bothers me about this rally is that these EaRnInGs BeATs that are being used to justify it have all been objectively shit. Just being spun like we‚Äôre in the upside down.

With inflation running as hot as it is, there is no Fed easing to come. On the flip side, there‚Äôs only so high they can raise on account of the size of the balance sheet. The increase on the payout on entitlements with the size of this balance sheet, pretty much guarantees that. They have to seriously cut weight to be able to raise truly aggressively, and they‚Äôve barely begun trying to unwind. Probably being instructed to push that out to post midterms.

Can‚Äôt remember which one of you said you‚Äôre buying long dated puts and selling near term to finance it. Was considering doing that for some time, will add that to the credit spread premium financing play. Great ways to ride out this rally: get paid to wait for the bottom to eventually fall out and profit for free when the time comes.

Thoroughly enjoyed the conversation between the two of you. Would love to get into a PM chat with you both and bounce around ideas and call out what we‚Äôre seeing/thinking.

P.S.- I can tell you follow Maverick, too. Absolutely best market commentary anywhere on the internet.

You had 200 days to figured this out. But no, its fuckery from the hedgies.

__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 03:22:26 - Oh right haha, guess I‚Äôm regarded. That makes sense actually. SPY was going down more slowly, and BBBY shot down rapidly. Guess Freeman Capital saw the market fall, had Michael Burry‚Äôs voice in his head telling him to sell, and he just reverse YOLO‚Äôd, that dick.
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 03:20:08 - SPY dropped $3 in that, which is about $2.7B.

BBBY's entire market cap is only around $1.3B, so 6% is about $80M give or take.

More likely the drop in in the market triggered the sale, not the other way around.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 05:51:31 - And while we're at it, let's talk about what has to happen for SPY to lose almost $3B in market cap in under 20 minutes... basically, an institution has to sell in a planned attempt to manipulate the market and trigger stop-losses.  There is no ""organic"" or ""natural"" about that kind of thing and it's a sign that shit is FAR too consolidated in the hands of farrrrr too few people.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 07:12:22 - Peak inflation. August cpi will be even lower on the headline number too. What the market is missing is that the move from 9.1 -> 5 will be a lot easier than the move from 5 to 2. I think the fed minutes today will reiterate that and lay rest to this idea of a fed pivot coming soon. I think a 5-10% pullback on SPY should ensue now

WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 16:24:08 - Picked up a quick 100-lot of SPY $435C‚Äôs (c/b $0.18) ahead of fed minutes - looking for an immediate reversal or I‚Äôll look to cut losses. If we reverse green by EOD (not uncommon on a fed news day) these will likely be a quick 6-bagger even if we finish the day unchanged. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a pretty small trade either way.

__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 16:07:08 - That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. I just gave a bunch of factors that point to us going above it. We‚Äôre not gonna touch $30 now back to 6.

I'm assuming some option expiry fuckery is making prices weirder around Friday on BBBY too. Also, it seems like BBBY is making really exaggerated versions of the movements we see from SPY, at least today and yesterday. I think if spy rebounds tomorrow bbby definitely does too. Maybe I'm too deep in the snorted crayon dust though idk.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-18 05:48:41 - Lmao you're an idiot. 

It was 130 because SPY was sucking dick <380 due to various reasons whether it was the economy or the looming potential of a WW3, etc. 

And Apple always goes up. There's a reason why it's considered one of the safest stocks to invest into for long-term. Imagine someone basically putting everything into it at 130 or 140. Guaranteed profits.

It will tickle 430 again, maybe spike to 435 \~ 440 for a day before September.  


But after that baby... oh boy it's bear time.

But the longer this goes unchecked, the stronger the correction is going to be, when it happens. But a healthy clear of 431 and we‚Äôre not stopping again until 445.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-18 20:57:14 - Feels great for the one true play. Keep trying to catch a quick buck instead of knowing the end game. Did you really think Ryan though BBBY was a long term investment for him or just a way to catch a big profit to really put his money where his mouth is. GME. He never cared about BBBY. Literally a company that has no chance of a turnaround but he saw an opportunity to make money to reinvest in the real company. Fuck SPY fuck 0DTE plays just go back to GME. Its obvious now more than ever

__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-18 20:36:31 - Today was the 158th trading day and 72nd green day of 2022. SPY down -10.7% YTD while it was up +17.2% by the 158th trading day last year. So far, we are underperforming last year by -27.9%.

The score so far: üêª 86-72 üêÆ

Counting >1% movements: üêª 37-38 üêÆ (bulls ahead!!!)

Counting >2% movements: üêª 14-15 üêÆ (bulls ahead!!!)

Months: üêª 4-2 üêÆ (May was flat)

Weeks: üêª 19-13 üêÆ

Last 4 weeks: üêª 0-4 üêÆ (a first this year)

SPY made 68 new highs last year vs. 1 this year so far. 93 trading days left to go in 2022. Stay tuned for tomorrow's episode of Bulls vs. Bears to see who is fuk tomorrow.

Fun fact: We haven't had a -1% day since July 15th and we haven't had a -2% day since June 28th.
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-18 20:30:14 - Whelp, another week, another total loss. Unless SPY does a -2.5% day tomorrow, which it won‚Äôt,

Time to have a few IPAs, sulk an appropriate amount of time, and be thankful for what I have

__________________________","WSB - Posted @2022-08-10 22:58:30 - AMC is still going up‚Ä¶..again! Keep strong!
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-10 22:45:29 - You do you then, hopefully you're right.

But when I view a basket of like movement stocks (or any ETF in general) I don't take unnecessary risks and buy a potentially problematic stock. Mudrick Capital ruined AMC for me, nothing and no one else influenced that. Mudrick bought 8m shares at $20, and then turned around and sold them at $40 (even as the price climbed well over that). Everyone was distraught, but I commented ""Like drunks in a casino they'll lose it all next week"". And they did, lost all those gains +10% of their total capital. Officially they blamed a 'Out of control bad options play'. But no, they closed their short positions at a loss.
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-10 22:43:48 - That's exactly what I did with AMC and SPRT. Rode AMC from 9 to 60 and SPRT from 6 to almost 60. I yolo'd both times. I hit 6 figures and it was all downhill from there.

I wasn't an 'ape', but I held in solidarity even though my broker didnt disable selling. idk the GME / AMC craziness hit peak mainstream saturation. A lot of people traded those tickers. Not everyone is on reddit tho  


As far as the BBBY trade, I just can't bother to get worked up about other people's p&ls, fake or real. People lie. People lie all the time. Either way doesnt affect me. The DD is good or it's crap and that's what matters. 'fact check' it or whatever.

Without a large DRS movement behind the stock, is there any reason that $APE units can't just be re-shorted once they hit people's accounts?

I saw AMC and GME blast off and actually had some AMC when it did, but I really want to understand all the ins and outs of Options, not just the basics. Much appreciated.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-11 02:12:19 - I'm just gonna call it how I see it. I'm not insinuating anything or think I'm right about what I'm about to say. This $BBBY comparison to $GME is sus af. Burry and DFV both said there would never be another $GME. The timing of this pump is very coincidental and I can only imagine what would happen if all that money would pile onto the only idiosyncratic risk. Ever notice how $AMC rips off $GME on what they do? Like as a company, not the hodlers. Idk, man. Hella sketch.

Mad Men, Nathan For You, Battlestar Galactica, Rick and Morty, South Park, The Daily Show, The Colbert Report, Avatar: the Last Airbender, Spongebob Squarepants, The Legend of Korra, The Venture Bros, The Walking Dead, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and The Americans were the best basic cable TV shows. Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, Comedy Central, AMC, and FX pretty much dominated. The rest of cable TV was reality TV, documentaries, news, sports, etc.

__________________________","WSB - Posted @2022-08-11 06:42:23 - Dude I'm not praying on anyone, there is a real opportunity here to force a squeeze.  Institutional investors are still shorting the stock and as more shares are shorted the easier the squeeze is.  Same thing happened with AMC in May '21. The short interest got up to 60%, retail investors kept buying making the price go higher and the short sellers had to bail out driving stocks from $12 all the way up to $72

BBBY can do the same

No you only invest in fundamentals of a shit company like this after you are far too deep in the hole to cash out.  That's the life cycle of bagholders.  Get rich quick scheme which doesn't pan out followed by years of oh I'm here for the fundamentals.  Just take a quick visit to any of the subreddits on here that aren't AMC or GME.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-11 16:29:45 - Here‚Äôs a story for you. I have been active in market for about five years. I bought GameStop about four years ago and walked into a store and saw that it was a used ‚Äúblockbuster‚Äù style rental. I sold that piece of junk company at a huge loss. My ex convict weed smoking 420 ‚Äúehors birthday‚Äù step dad started talking about GameStop , AMC, and Apes! Talking about some kind of shorts and he wants to borrow a thousand dollars because this Mfucker is going to fly. I was like ‚Äú ummm bueller buellar .. So I said I will buy you a thousand worth of shares but will NOT give you cash to go blow on some black!!!! I fucked it off and he kept asking hey man did you get those shares?? I finally bought the crap stock during pandemic at 12.36 a share!! Bought 3,000 worth. I am being a total bitch thinking he is stupid and I‚Äôm making money with the semis I bought on dec 24th after trump announced taxes on China. Anyway .. I watched that stock go up and I almost shat myself ! The fucker was right !!!! Sold it at 53.00 and put it right back in buying more shares. I decided to look into this bullshit he is talking about and biggest transfer of wealth blah blah. After all.. what could my ex con drug addicted step dad know! Fast forward two years and I AM ALL mo fuckin APE! I used to watch Cramer and pat myself on the back like a good girl for being diversified!! I hate his ass now!! I am livid that the numbers I have been making financial decisions on are bullshit! I am a pissed off bitch watching my step dad dig in garbage at truck stop ‚Äúcaning‚Äù to get a few dollars to eat while he is waiting and waiting for SOMEONE in the AGENCY to grow a fucking sack and get these pieces of shit that are manipulating global markets! I hate them all now ! I hate that I just watched some unknown China shit company run up close to half a trillion dollars and NO ONE talked about it! I hate that I was so fucking blind to the fraud thinking ‚Äúhey, I know what I am doing in stock market‚Äù. Believe me or not but I sho did sell that shit company at the perfect time. currently , I see you walk street !! I LOVE my shit company now and I bought that other one (gme) AGAIN!!! I won‚Äôt sell bitches because I am fortunate to be in a financial position where I don‚Äôt have to! But a lot of folks have been real patient and I pray they hold long enough to drive those fucks out of THEIR secret basement!!! I see you üëÄ WS

In order for the company AMC to give out a dividend that means all real shares have to be counted this means synthetic shares are removed because you don't get a dividend share if you have something that's synthetic that means people who bought synthetic shares thinking that they're real will want real shares so brokers have to cover them either buying real AMC or this ape stock.

Plus all the media tension, good times all around.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-12 04:35:15 - As a holder of AMC: 

They‚Äôre still shorting becuase they know something that the rest of us don‚Äôt. We‚Äôre the ones on the outside and all the DD that has been done thus far is theoretical and is dependent on a functioning retail-friendly market. If AMC doesn‚Äôt run before Aug 22, when $APE hits the NYSE, then we should expect institutes to buy up the remaining APE shares, wait for AA to convert them to AMC shares, and cover their synthetics. If the point of APE was solely to expose the true number of synthetics, we would have ran already.
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-12 04:32:18 - AMC needs cash.

AMC had planned to issue more shares of common stock to raise cash. This required shareholder approval, and after pushback, they withdrew the proposal.

After consulting with their lawyers, AMC management realized they could issue preferred stock without shareholder approval. And preferred stock, as a creature of contract law much more than corporate law, can be molded in basically any way they want, so this is ‚Äúpreferred‚Äù in name only, but is effectively identical to common, with no liquidation preference, participation in common dividends, 1:1 conversion to common, etc.

The initial ‚Äúdividend‚Äù doesn‚Äôt do anything to actually raise capital. But once the APE security is trading in the market, AMC can sell more of them whenever they want without shareholder approval.

It‚Äôs basically a backdoor way for management to use dilutive share issuances without shareholder approval, after shareholders pushed back on dilution through normal channels.

It‚Äôs AMC and this is 2022, so possibilities for craziness abound, but the only rational way this trades is after the APE dividend, AMC and APE trade in tandem at effectively the same price, and the new price for each is half of what AMC is trading at before the dividend.

You asked two different question. A short squeeze is possible due to the large amount of the float being shorted, but a short squeeze is just that: a squeeze.

I‚Äôm bearish on BBBY long term because they suck as a company. You bring up Blockbuster like its the only failed business. Look at what happened to Sears. BBBY is going the same direction. 

This isn‚Äôt shill thought. I‚Äôve worked for the company before and it sucks dick from poor upper management decisions, obvious budget cuts affecting the business due to BBBY running out of money, short staffed, etc. And overall, their balance sheet has been dogshit for the last year. No matter how much shit you own, what does it mean if you can‚Äôt make any money off of it? They‚Äôre failing to pivot to an online marketplace like all these other companies who should have done it 10 years ago and are suffering the consequences.

Either way, like Volkswagen and GME and AMC and Nokia and every one of these stocks that has gone through a short squeeze, it goes down after. Thats the ‚Äúbear‚Äù thesis.
__________________________","WSB - Posted @2022-08-12 06:31:00 - AMC continues to always get shit on when it has literally the last exact same root cause of GME squeeze and goes up more than GME consistently since Jan 21
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-12 06:28:41 - Dont get me wrong, AMC is still in debt and needs to work on becoming cash-flow positive but at this point in time, shorting it when the stock is doing moderately well would be a brain-dead move unless something drastic is going to happen in the near term.

One holds a massive position in the companies he believes in, one is selling out and getting rich off retail

WSB - Posted @2022-08-12 16:40:50 - Literally read about 100 pages and I think I found it 

>Given that Robinhood‚Äôs collateral deposit requirements were well within manageable levels by January 29, 2021, and the company had raised the capital that its models suggested was sufficient to handle shock scenarios by the end of the day on February 2, 2021, it is unclear why the company prohibited purchasing fractional shares of certain meme stocks, with the last fractional share trading restriction being lifted on February 10, 2021, and maintained position limits in GME and AMC securities until February 5, 2021. While Robinhood told Committee staff that it maintained these restrictions for prudential reasons, by Robinhood‚Äôs own estimations, the firm should have been able to return to an unrestricted trading environment by February 2, 2021, at the latest.364
Robinhood‚Äôs trading restrictions were most likely a direct consequence of inadequate liquidity at Robinhood. Robinhood‚Äôs inability to anticipate and plan for the spike in its NSCC collateral deposit requirements meant that it did not arrange for sufficient liquidity ahead of time and thereafter did not meet its normal operating requirements to act as a clearing broker. This meant that Robinhood had to adopt stringent trading restrictions to lower volatility within parameters that it had the resources to fund. Even though Robinhood was subject to the DTCC‚Äôs Enhanced Surveillance at the time, which theoretically entails the clearinghouse conducting more thorough due diligence of the firm on a more regular basis, DTCC remained largely unaware that Robinhood‚Äôs internal procedures for calculating collateral charges did not calculate the Excess Capital Premium charge.365 When asked whether Robinhood communicated any liquidity concerns Robinhood may have had to the DTCC on the morning of January 28, 2021, Robinhood Chief Legal Officer Dan Gallagher could not recall with specificity.366
Ultimately, given a confusing collateral charge regime by the DTCC and incomplete models within Robinhood, Robinhood did not have a sufficient capital cushion to support an unrestricted trading environment for its customers during the Meme Stock Market Event and for days afterwards. As a result, Robinhood had to adopt the most stringent and longest lasting trading restrictions of any broker-dealer during the Meme Stock Market Event. Had Robinhood more adequately anticipated heightened collateral deposit requirements or maintained an adequate capital cushion ahead of time, it likely would have been able to adopt more modest restrictions. With reduced or lighter restrictions, ordinary retail customers who use the Robinhood platform to

The TL;DR version of this entire report: RH was pretty damn incompetent during this mess but the conspiracy is still bunk.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-12 19:26:32 - Really? Why is that?


I‚Äôm of the opinion, that just like many people here are Meme stock peoples, because we all saw them rise‚Ä¶.

That it really doesn‚Äôt matter. All meme stocks are up again. And if one of them goes to the moon, the rest will also go to the moon in sympathy.

I sense the hedgefunds on the other side of the trade for BBBY, AMC, GME, BB, etc, are ALL THE SAME ENEMY.

It‚Äôs the same SHFs. 

Once one of their positions is exploded, suddenly ALL other positions are exposed because the collateral is gone on the first Margin call. The risk profile goes up because they have less available and are even more underwater.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-12 23:49:54 - What mistake?  A failing mid cap company is getting its stock shorted.  No mistake there, shorting stock is a viable, common, morally and ethically neutral, and legal trading technique.  GME and AMC made the market notice retail.  The market barely broke a sweat.  BBBY will be no different.  Size matters.  Nobody is taking down an AMZN: too big a cap and too pricey to organize a rally.  This is a niche circumstance.

__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-12 23:20:03 - I live in africa, and worked 10 years to have 60k.
I started with stock in 2021 , without option until i reached 63k.
Noob like me is happy to earn 3k by just investing in airlines.
3 months after, i moved to crypto , and then i did thz bigest mistake in my life. I started trading option without any knowledge.
So i shorted solana with 50X.
At that time , 1 solana = 47$.
I ignored that solana were about to launch NFT market, so it jumped from 47$ to 120.
And i lost everything.
4 months after, i saved 3k $ and i shorted BTC at 90X speed thinking that i can earn back what i lost.
So i lost everything again.
Then , i noticed that i am an asshole who can bet his life in features like the japaness anime ""kaije"".
So i worked hard in 2022 and i saved 13k again and i bought some stock that i failed (novavax, robinhood, Riot , and some other shit stock).
In june 15 , i lost 70$ of my monney because of recession.
But , 3 weeks before i sold EVERYTHING and played every little $ on AMC, and for the first time since months , i start seeing a green wallet.
Once AMC reached 22-23$ i sold everything and bought BBBY, 
In 2 weeks , my wallet jumped from 7k to 18k. And i am still holding since 43% of the float need to be bought back by shorters soon or later.
My target price is between 30$ and 40$.
Too simply never lose hope. One day you will get back what you lost.
I was stupide and dumb with 0 experience in trading and i did a lot of mistakes.

BBBY is highly shorted because the market believes they‚Äôre gonna fail, however there‚Äôs a slight chance that they will actually recover after Ryan cohen bought in a whole bunch of shares and options and recommended a new ceo. Also a lot of people don‚Äôt think the market priced in bye bye baby worth. So I‚Äôm summary , this wall streets bets, and everyone is betting BBBY will prevail and be profitable again, thus the stakes are high and the reward big.

__________________________","WSB - Posted @2022-08-13 03:53:26 - You sound like you are asking in terms of time frame - when? It's obvious that it will at some psychological price point. My bet is before $50 ( price wise I correlate BBBY more with AMC, not GME), but I am also not that confident about purchasing power for retail investors at the moment. 

I don't think, it will have to do anything with hedge funds. When AMC and/or GME tanked, tons of retards here admitted that nobody gives a shit about diamond hands or apes, or whatever, it's all about making money. Only real retard retards will keep holding (the bags eventually) and dreaming about some imaginary $420.69 price the stock will hit. Probably a lot of HODLers now also offload shares that they have gotten through calls or at a lowest price, but keep posting here to hold to keep up the price.

P.S. I do not hold any BBBY shares, I am just giving my opinion here. The more downvotes I will get, the better it will show that I am correct, lol.

Didn't sell when it hit $20 on the first pump and got freaked out when they halted all the memes and pulled that restricting trading bs and it tanked back to $6 which is when I panic sold....only to watch it continue it's run into the $70+.

__________________________","WSB - Posted @2022-08-13 06:40:20 - I think apes are regarded and create delusional conspiracy theories to justify holding onto their underwater positions.

But here's what I'm seeing on BBBY:

The SEC report for GME stated the price action was driven initially by shorts closing but after the closings, retail and gamma/delta had caused the run-up to $480. Meaning short interest is important but not the catalyst for what caused the majority of GME's run, only some of it.

All values below are according to ORTEX.

BBBY has an estimated 32.7M shares short. Shares outstanding is 80M, free float shares is 69.5M. So about a 50% SI%.

Of the existing 32.7M shares short, about 20M of them have been opened on days the price of BBBY was below $12.50. Meaning 20M of those shorts are likely currently underwater.

Options chain shows the following OIs:

- 11K of $15C 8/19
- 13.5K of $20C 8/19
- 10K of $30C 8/19
- 10K of $20C 9/16
- 7K of $15C 1/20/23
- 25K of $20C 1/20/23
- 8K of $22C 1/20/23
- 9K of $25C 1/20/23
- 16K of $30C 1/20/23

So ~110K of OI up to $30 equating up to 11M shares.

Probably not as much powder as the original run that GME went on, but more than compared to the original run that AMC went on.

There's a clear difference between BBBY's potential of a squeeze vs GME/AMC who sit at 20%/18% SI%, significantly less shorts underwater, and less primed options chains.

Not saying that anything is guaranteed on BBBY, but it's important to distinguish the differences between the 3 and why this week looked different for all 3.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-13 13:36:48 - I dont hokd AMC but ive been following closely and here's my understanding.

This is an unconventional stock split, the market cap of AMC as a company does not change, it is split into subsidiaries AMC and APE.
APE is preferred stock, it does not carry voting privilege but is the first to be paid dividends, the company can issue a dividend to APE and not AMC if it chooses, however it can't do this the other way round. This is the major thing that differentiates common and preferred stock.
AMC as above is common stock, it carries voting power so 1 AMC vote still carries the same weight as before

The opening price will be AMC/2. 
APE is preferred equity in AMC theatres, it represents the same portion of ownership as 1 AMC and therefore will be priced accordingly

The major concern I see is that it does appear to open the way for dilution to occur down the road, but this wont happen immediately. Overall this should be seen as relatively neutral, but I'm interested to see whether there is any notable outcome regarding the short position theories that are always around.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-13 14:04:03 - Yes this whole thing seems sketchy. I was in the amc sub reddit since January of last year, I was there when we finally hit 70+ and AA made a deal to sell over 8m shares to a hedge fund who immediately sold the shares on the open market (for a nice profit) and tanked the price killing the squeeze. The momentum died and we never got back there again. Yes I understand AMC needed the cash but AA single handedly fucked the squeeze over, albeit for the good of the company but still. I will never follow that man again and one way or another the APES are about to get screwed bc once again AA will make sure the right people eat first. That's how business is, it's cut throat. One thing I don't understand is where this value is coming for the APE prefered equity. You can't just create value from nothing. So for those shares to be worth something, is it going to be taken from AMC current price?

The $1b market cap is to prevent people from doing this, because you'd need a lot more of capital and pumpers to do it. But people have been able to do it with GME, AMC, and now BBBT.

This hype train will die out in 6 weeks, and then limbo, see AMC and GME, squeeze was squozen, thinking that GME will moon, at this point makes no sense.
I don't think it was squozen for BBBY yet.
I can see huge gains this week, with the hype train, I'm happy to see spike to 35 and get out in part, maybe 50 if we really fuck up the algorithms, as much fun as it is to see the candles, even DFV reduced his position. 
Cash is cash, buy SPY and Nasdaq til EOY, gamble with some, but not all your money.

EOY 50 USD is possible, but speculative as fuck!

Surely, I don't think we will see single digit price in this stock for a very long time, same with GME and AMC, gorrila is out the cage.

DD with my finest crayon's:

At the moment we are at 13 usd, valued 1 billion.
With 35usd per share, company valuation will be approx 3,2 billion dollars....
As it stands GME and AMC were squeezed to, at this moment, 12 billion in evaluation, and BBBY is just about 1 billion now, see my fucktard way of thinking?
I also refuse to believe that shorts learned their lesson, better yet, they're likely bullish to ride that wave for a week or two, and then they'll exit, which will cause some massive drops.

My valuation math is probably fucked, it's Saturday, so I ain't sober and I'm not doing maths for you, someone will comment below, correcting me.

So yes, I can believe that AMC and GME crowd will jump on the bandwagon and will push the valuation this high, purely out of the mechanism of the market, and to have another GME moment.

Purely momentum, I can see 35 EUR spike this week, and Friday with bunch of options expiring will be fun, for sure.

Mind you, week ago Monday bbby shot up 60% in a single day.
This play was still relatively under the radar for most, this has changed last week, when everyone noticed the spike and started paying attention.
Loads of calls were executed this Friday for strike price 10 - 10,50 
Seeing the posts here, there's a number of options that will expire on the 19th, for the same strike price.

So lets say the move higher from its starting point ($5), could be 75% as big as the move in AMC, which went from 2.20 to 72.... for a stupid return of 32x. Not saying 0.75\*32x or 24x will happen, but all the conditions for it are present, so it's best to play it by ear if you're long and watch short borrow rates for peaking/skyrocketing, associated price action and daily short interest levels for covering. 

All ik is that I would not want to be short anything rn, let alone this stock in the current macro environment/turning point.

Fuck AMC. It was always a distraction. Cramer is even bullish on it.

Too much debt, too much shady shit going on with AArons ties to Chinese media moguls, too much dilution, too much selling his own shares. I fucking hate how AMC holders think they are apes, when all the work is really done by GME holders.

AMC will never be a golden ticket because the CEO will always make sure he cashes it before it gets to investors. Actually running the company well will never be as lucrative as bilking investors. Imagine this was a CEO of some company your mom invested in, seeing him say MOMs make \_\_\_ Stronger"" would make your skin crawl.

I understand fully the potential for dilution. The number of posts on r/WSB about this though, and the overall sentiment of it as ‚Äúshill‚Äù is making me bullish as fuck. None of you should give a fuck enough to be writing these after the first 2-3, and I‚Äôve taken a  cursory look at the responses in this thread and a good chunk are bot / shill accounts.

In my opinion Adam Aaron is the biggest scumbag out there tho 

If you need the full story of why youre getting fucking with hycroft. Here you go. For further info, my hourly rate is $100

1. [They filed for bankruptcy in 2015](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2015-10-22/hycroft-mining-corporation-completes-financial-restructuring-process-and-emerges-from-chapter-11-with-221-7-million-in-financi-ii38wha4)

2. They managed to stay alive since by false promises of a new discovery in sulfide gold extraction that was found to be unfeasible by their own reporting: 

‚ÄúThe Company has previously discussed its strategy for developing an economic sulfide process for Hycroft. Based on the Company's findings to date, including the analysis completed by an independent third-party research laboratory and the independent reviews by two metallurgical consultants, the Company does not believe the novel two-stage sulfide heap oxidation and leach process (""Novel Process""), as currently designed in the 2019 Technical Report dated July 31, 2019 (""2019 Technical Report""), is economic at current metal prices or those metal prices used in the 2019 Technical Report.

3. After once again trying to stay alive by scamming retail investors through [trying to find funding through a SPAC deal during the SPAC hype of 2020](http://www.hycroftmining.com/wp-content/uploads/Presentation-May-2020.pdf)

4. [They finally ceased operations in 2021 and laid off half their staff](https://www.nnbw.com/news/2021/nov/17/hycroft-mine-lays-half-its-workforce-ceases-operat/)

5. Out of options, in comes Adam Aaron to the rescue to once again scam retail investors to bail out his buddies.


> So the rapport that came out a couple of weeks ago that showed they hadent explored 98 percent of the landmasses they own is bullshit?

Do you even know how mining exploration works? You take vertical deep rock samples and analyse the grades and deposits. Only a tiny fraction of your total land mass is analysed in this way to evaluate feasibility. Saying 98% is unexplored is ""dumb retail"" mumbo jumbo for just standard practice and not yet having found anything of value. Guess what, the land I own is 100% unexplored for gold deposits, want to buy it as a gold mine?

Amber heard has less red flags that this as an investment proposition

Maybe a bit early could have made more with the recent run but I just don't trust that AA guy at all. I honestly think he fucked alot of the run AMC could have had.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-14 10:07:36 - I made an absolute KILLING off AMC. Six figures easy. For me that was a life changing amount of money. But what it's become today is something different. In the before time it was the wild fucking west and no one, and I mean no one, really knew how shit was going to play out. So I went balls DEEP (at the time) in AMC because fuck it I was a huge fan of movies as a kid and some of the best memories I ever had with friends and family were seeing some major blockbusters you just can't experience today (the first Jurassic park, the matrix, scary movie, freddy got fingered, OG spiderman movies everyone shits on today, I could go on). I needed money and was at the point of finding something, anything, to just yolo into. Just so happens AMC came at the right time. I just wish they actually had a decent board on the company. Not the typical company men we see today looking to sell EVERYONE down the river.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-14 10:05:49 - To add another thing to the dilution thought with the new listing of $APE. The preferred equity units can convert into common stock if the company proposes and investors approve the increase of authorized shares of common stock. GME had a split and AMC will have a dilution.
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-14 10:04:06 - I bought one share of AMC back when they announced they were gonna give shareholders free popcorn.

The cost of a large popcorn was more than the cost of the stock, so I figured ""eh fuck it. If I get even one out of the deal it's worth it"". Still haven't been to an AMC theater since I bought it though so I have no idea if that deal ever actually happened or if it's still a thing.

The cost of a large popcorn was more than the cost of the stock, so I figured ""eh fuck it. If I get even one out of the deal it's worth it"". Still haven't been to an AMC theater since I bought it though so I have no idea if that deal ever actually happened or if it's still a thing.

Pleased correct me if i am wrong, but i cannot find the post

WSB - Posted @2022-08-14 11:49:14 - I'd like to add that they bought into this mining company that was also a heavy bag of Mudrick Capital. For those of you that can't reador remember, this is the same firm that took out a huge private placement in AMC in 2021, published a huge hit piece on the debt/valuation, then sold 100% of their position ATM for a big loss, within a matter of hours.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-14 11:22:16 - AMC came on the scene as GME was rocketing higher in late-January. I thought it might have been because it could‚Äôve been in a basket of retail stocks being traded, but when you see Cramer (who I think is the voice of hedge funds/professional Wall Street) lauding it, you know it‚Äôs just a distraction from the main event.
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-14 11:20:32 - Wow thanks for looking out!! But since your so convinced you should definitely short it and make some easy money. 

But I have a feeling you‚Äôre not convinced and just want to pump another stock that you‚Äôre balls deep in. How about a bet? You short AMC and stand by your post and prove it.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-14 11:13:52 - The ridiculousness surrounding AMC is just unreal. They pump harder on bullish GME news than GME itself, not to mention when there's no news! Doesn't pass the sniff test given that GME sentiment is more favorable than AMC as evidenced by longer term trends.

That's all you really need to know about the role AMC plays as a long hedge to the GME shorts.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-14 12:20:12 - AMC's CFO is on the mining company's board, the exact moment I took my swing trade profits, is when AA let that out. Made a couple thousand off AMC, so I'm not mad, but no fuckin way would I still hold a position in it. I bought cheap puts for October, time to play it to the downside. Nfa

Now why would someone invest his energy in writing about something which doesn t benefit him in any way i wonder? If people invested in AMC it s their choice, it s their money, so why is it that you can t sleep at night better because ‚Äúpopcorn‚Äù as you name them will lose their money? Just be zen bro, we all are fighting the same corrupt system that is robbing us of our future, so why the hate? We are in this together, but you don t see people that invested in cinema to bash every day people that invested in video games.
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-14 12:03:53 - GME has promising fundamentals from a value-based investing perspective. BBBY is looking like it might also with Cohen on board. AMC is dogshit from a business perspective. The main thing keeping it afloat are its fan base and everything going on with the stock itself unrelated to the company.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-14 14:38:49 - So I just saw NOPE at an AMC near me last night.  I walk in and show the ticket booth that Fandango was offering me 30% sale off Nope tickets. I ask if she can match that and she said nope.   I chuckled and bought the tickets on Fandango. 

I proceeded to the concessions and ordered a small coke and popcorn. Was $16.47.  I handed the dude a $20 and he said they don‚Äôt take cash.  My debit card was turned off earlier in the week so I asked if he could take Venmo, cash app, Bitcoin, or a personal check.  He said nope.   I started walking away and he said I could go to customer service and pay for a gift card using the $20 he rejected. So that‚Äôs what I did. I bought a gift card for $20 and then exchanged that for my snackies.  Thankfully there was no line because there weren‚Äôt any other customers at all. 

Now I‚Äôm left with a sad nostalgic feeling of what the movie theaters used to be like.  I miss the old AMC

WSB - Posted @2022-08-14 14:33:34 - The funny thing is..... The people I know who are hardcore popcorn bag holders... They think drs is pointless and me drs my gme is stupid. They don't understand why I'd want to pull out of fidelity which they use because to them, it makes it harder to sell my shares quickly. Dudes listen to YouTubers talking about how dilution is good and it doesn't matter that nobody holds shares that runs the company. Won't sell shares to buy gme. All about bbby now but still only own like 5 gme shares but own over 1k popcorn combined. It's just silly. I ask them to show me DD and they can't come up with anything but they're like... Listen to this YouTuber. Who thinks a new ticker is good cuz it raises money for AMC and cannot be shorted lol. It's literally just a ticker to get retards to buy more stock so they can spend more money. Imagine, your stock is supposedly going to squeeze to the moon.... And your want to make a new ticker to sell more shares to raise capital without being attached to your stock. That's about as fucking shady as it gets. Literally talking about how AA will dilute this ape ticker to raise capital and how is so good. They can't make money as a company. Their only income is people buying stock. They're making a stock just for dumb bag holders so they can carry another bag.

This is probably what AA-ron is implying. 

The thng is that he's a shill and most likely an idiot.

With that said. 

AMC probably won't be able to grow since only AMC investors go to the cinema.

Put a fork in it, it's done.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-14 15:05:20 - Literally me. Sold my AMC for BBBY.

I wasn't a Diamond Hand with AMC, in fact, my original investment reason was a reopening play plus I assume Avatar 2 is going to be the biggest movie of all time.

However, after a year and a half of holding, I finally saw a good price target to exit with some decent profit taking and took it. I'd been in BBBY since the Cohen buy in, so I dumped the AMC into that along with some GME (I've got plenty of those DRSd).

Seeing way, way more profits on BBBY than I saw with AMC except for it's $70 squeeze last year, but even then BBBY goes a bit higher and I'm making good money.

Honestly, it just feels nice to move money around in the market. Guess I now understand what it means to have liquidity.

Stop trying to lump AMC in with GME and/or BBBY.  It's not the same. AA is milking retail for all its worth and getting rich in the process.  Only dummies can't see that...
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-14 16:52:14 - This is commonly referred to as the Principal - Agent dilemma. You see, as Director of AMC, AA is primarily obliged to pursue the best interest of the company which in essence is to remain a going concern.

He is NOT obliged to act in the best interest of shareholders per se, even thought it should be A interest of shareholders that amc remains a going concern. 

The Principal - Agent dilemma basically says that interests are sometimes not fully aligned and thus AA may act against shareholders interest while still serving and 100% fulfilling is obligations.

__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-14 16:21:27 - I think the APE ticker pure money for him.  

You hear about dilution all the time right now .. but ..  if AMC is naked shorted the way everyone seems to think, and hedgies have 2 days to deliver APE to legit holders ... And the only source of APE to cover those naked shorts are the ""stock that is not in circulaation but could be used at a future date if AMC needs funding"" because you know the AMC holders wont sell .. 

I am guessing AA will make APE available to hedgies to cover those naked shorts, because you know, he wouldn't want retail to go without their APE stock. /s   Ape just has to go up enough that he feels it is worth releasing.

All speculation on my part. But lines up with everything he AA has said so far on what APE would be used for.  He can make a bundle releasung it this way, make it look like the intention is to first reveal the shorting, Then make nice with hedgies selling the APE, all the while free money for him.
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-14 16:19:39 - Adam Aaron issued APE to AMC share holders playing it up like it‚Äôs the second coming of Christ when in reality it‚Äôs his way of working dilution in whenever he wants without a vote. APE might be a problem at first with all the synthetic shares but like wall street does, they‚Äôll figure out a way around it.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-14 16:15:48 - Looking at the daily ""squeeze candle"" for GME and AMC, they both were preluded by a big gap up.  So if there was another huge gap up on Monday, I would just FOMO in because I wouldn't want to miss the MOASS ever.  Otherwise, if there was no big gap up, I would just chill and wait for mid-day and look for a support area to buy.

It's issuing common shares with extra steps.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-14 20:43:26 - Well bbby, unlike AMC, is severely undervalued even at this price. Its buy buy baby business alone is worth billions and the stock price just went over a billion dollars in market cap. It no longer has a shitty, overpaid ceo like amc does. It's buying back shares vs. diluting like amc is. Its insiders are buying more stock rather than selling. Its SI is 102+% as opposed to amc's 18%. The cost to borrow and short interest are also not only significantly higher but also climbing fast unlike amc. The CEO also said we would have news on its plans for buy buy baby and its debt by the end of august which is a catalyst for significant upwards momentum. Finally, it actually has a future by moving online whereas amc doesn't have that luxury. Amc's plan is to sell popcorn and buy shitty mining companies that are down 66% from the highs it reached after amc's announcement. In summary, BBBY has actual reasons to go up whereas amc has none or at least far shittier ones. They are not the same. That's why people are buying bbby and shitting on amc. One is a solid investment and the other is a steaming pile of monkey shit fleecing its investors while the executives cash out their bonuses and shares every chance they get. But again, i don't think anything i say will change ur mind so im done wasting my time with u. Goodbye.

Point is the shit nerd will be rambling to twatsie, twatsie will turn are and ask mayoclown ""wen solution?"" and bedpost rapist formerly known as shit face Kenny will be stuck with quite a lot of requests he can't just algo away to the dark pools.

Doesn't mean this will create a buying frenzy. That's wishful thinking. But it will cause disruption and open up a possibility for AMC to run a bit (which will at least cost them dearly in a market with raising interest).

It gives incentive to get out and save themselves the trouble

WSB - Posted @2022-08-14 20:02:37 - 2021 was a big year for the meme economy. It started with GameStop (GME) jumping hundreds of dollars in price, then companies like BlackBerry, Nokia, AMD, and AMC followed suit. Some companies used the funds to make investments, or keep it as a safety net for business, others embraced the meme and used it as a stepping stone to shift the business focus. And one company took advantage of the good intentions of retail investors. 

AMC has repeatedly diluted shares, has repeatedly dumped insider shares, and is now going so far as to try to capture the meme by offering an APE ticker to try to rope in more retail investors only to *shocker* sell it all again. 

The SEC is yet again asleep at the wheel as CEO Adam Aaron plans to create ponzi scheme to take investor money, make 0 business investments, and then sell his portion of the treasure along with other AMC executives. 

DO NOT BUY AMC STOCK UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING! THE ""MEME"" HAS BEEN COMMANDEERED BY EXECUTIVES AS A WAY TO STEAL YOUR MONEY.

Holding a meaningful percentage of your assets in illiquid form that requires you to register sales XX months in advance, AND in a company that your board doesn‚Äôt require you to at that age is just fucking dumb.

You all going to talk about 61 year old Tim Cook and 58 year old Bezos and 250 year old Buffett and all that shit. Obviously AMC is not of the same caliber as those companies and lending institutions won‚Äôt see AMC shares as risk-free collateral relative to fucking Apple, Berkshire, and Amazon.

The squeeze isn‚Äôt relevant. Not that I believe any huge squeeze is coming to replicate the early days for ANY of these stocks, but at the base, and insider can‚Äôt time a sale months in advance with what would ultimately be fleeting volatility.

That said, options pricing for this coming week is huge, and I‚Äôm basically covering my entire original bagholding cost basis selling covered calls each week.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-14 21:29:29 - I'll answer to it.

I hold AMC, BBBY and GME. 

I totally accept that in the FUTURE they will be diluting APE. In the immediate future though there will be no dilution which was explicitly stated in the call by the company.

I hold all these meme stocks in the potential of a short squeeze.

AMC for me seems to be heavily oversold.
By issuing 516 million APEs to begin with distributed by COMPUTERSHARE, AMC is conducting a low key share count in order to establish or gather hard evidence of naked shorts. 

With no options trading on APE there will be no way to hide this. Once those 516 mil go out and people starting complaining about how they haven't been issued their divi the ensuing drama I think will garner a lot of attention. 

If it is infact true that this is oversold and all the APE dividends need to be delivered to shareholders, then there is going to need to be more than 516 mil APEs 

This is where I think the dilution will come in. Once the available APE dries up I actually don't care if they want to issue more, BECAUSE THEY WILL NEED TO BE PURCHASED ON THE OPEN MARKET AND DELIVERED TO SHAREHOLDERS. 

When they issue more shares and the the MM needs to purchase them in order to fulfill the divi requirement it will push up the price on APE and defacto AMC and also give the meme basket a extra boost (which will also fuel the BBBY frenzy ü§§) 

This does require in my opinion that people hold the ape initially as much as possible. 

Noone really knows and it's all üîÆ gazing, but that's how I see it. If it doesn't play out as such I will adjust and reevaluate.

To me though any major catalyst in these memes is going to send the others flying so instead of being a hater and a whiny little bitch like some of the people that frequent here I'm remaining positive for the sake of ALL meme stocks. 

I think there's a lot of negativity in here from people who were burnt by GME and AMC in the early days and they lost money when instead of just holding and averaging down would have resulted in them being in a rather favourable position. Instead these people freaked out, sold at a loss and are now on a gate train because of their poor decisions. 

I know there are a FUCKLOAD of memer's that are hodling all these meme stocks and have never left. Its always the vocal minority that makes the biggest noise. 

Have an awesome day and good luck next week üöÄüëç

I got into AMC at like $7/per & GME at something like $20/per. Feel like an idiot for selling when I did 

Don't puss out if they get wonky, it might take a while but there's a lot of hype behind BBBY so while it may not hit ""the moon"" you should be able to, hopefully, reach a reasonable goal if you're smart about it

WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 02:03:22 - I'm not in on Bed Bath & Beyond but there is extreme validity to this Idea. On AMC I took profit at 50000. If I would have held , I was looking at an easy 150 profit. If you all turn green off of these yolo   Consider that you either invest into a dividend stock(s), Or just go cash gang. It's not a question of are you or are I good at trading. It's the issue of continuing to do single leg options after hitting a lick greater than $25000 Is just about guaranteed to slowly bleed you.
 Additionally if you do continue to trade single leg or spread options, Perhaps never bothering to learn much more than that in terms of strategy, finess( Restraint ), application , Or to take a moment to backtest your logic on economic factors affecting the market, To see if you are assumptions that sometimes show green are showing green for what you assumed. This is getting too long to read.. I genuinely hope you all do something here, And to be honest I miss the thrill of trading more than the money.  With much smaller capital than I have Really ever traded with with now I'm paying my electricity food and gasoline bills....  but if some of you come up on about a quarter million in a few days and you wanna maybe hear more about how it went wrong after that, hit me with a PM.  As I'm just getting back into trading again after some crushing depression, I realized a lot of my trading friends, that I respected intellectually, and myself do not speak anymore. I actually have some insight on trading that they don't show on a single YouTube video. the best friends I've ever had were off Internet chat rooms that I traded with. And I think that's why I really cherish those friendships, and spent so many hours discussing things with my mentors, there is something to developing ideas with the same person or people , as opposed to reading DD. Anyhoo , I'm not fishing for handouts here, if you read this and remember it later , you are welcome reach out.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 03:13:32 - Has anyone checked to see where AMC has borrowed its funds from? Usually, public companies have to play with Hedge funds for financing since it's their only option to raise capital in toxic convertible death spirals... This gives the hedge funds a very low price of conversion or no floor at all to justify the naked share borrowing to the SEC.. CEOs get caught in a pinch because they have to have the money to put out the short-term fires, but it will end up tanking them at a zero price and bankruptcy...

In order to be an AMC bull, you need to do one of these two things:

1. Be completely delusional

or

2. Research the company only through reading AMC subreddit/Twitter posts. 

There's no other way. Literally everything happening at AMC is a red flag. You *can't* honestly research that company, and come out on the other side buying shares long term, or looking for a squeeze. None of it makes sense, unless of course, you are doing one of the two activities listed above.

My first stock was a mistake for many reasons. A comic book company I liked. Penny stock. Didn't even know what that meant. I chose it over the toy company it was making comics for under a licensing deal. In a year the toy company was up 50%. I lost roughly 10%

After that I had some AMC a couple of times. Came out ahead in the end on that one. Got GME & BBBY now.

Still learning but I know a lot more about the market she these 2 companies than when I started.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 11:48:31 - I'm not 100% certain of OPs moves, as I can't imagine that he would be able to buy 15 11.5 calls for similar price to what he bought 10 11.5 calls - especially after IV spike and price increase, unless he waited for a good pullback; but here is the gist of risk/reward

Scenario 1 - he bought the 11.5 C for $2 and it moves against him or sidewise, he never sells a higher call; he loses $200 per contract.

Scenario 2 - he buys the 11.5 C for $2, it continues to rise and he sells the $14 C for S2.5. The stock quickly rises to $90 and he only makes $300 ((2.5-2)+(14-11.5))*100 instead of $8,000

Scenario 3 - he buys the 11.5 C for $2, it continues to rise and he sells the $14 C for S2.5. The stock then moves to $11.45 and moves sidewise for the rest of the week. He makes $50 and tries again next week with $250 instead of $200

Scenario 4 - he buys the 11.5 C for $2, it continues to rise and he sells the $14 C for S2.5. It moves to $12.5 and he makes $150 - ((2.5-2)+(12-11.5))*100

Scenario 5 - he buys the 11.5 C for $2, it continues to rise and he sells the $14 C for S2.5. The stock falls back for a bit and the premium for a strike the following week is $1.25 (my experience is that it's typically a higher strike, but may still be worth it for squeeze situations, I'll pick approximately similar numbers that happened to me during the GME squeeze). It's the $25 C. The price then retreats and he loses $250, but is really only out the $200 initial bet.

Scenario 6 -  he buys the 11.5 C for $2, it continues to rise and he sells the $14 C for S2.5. The price then jumps to $380 very quickly overnight, one of the $45 calls gets executed overnight. He wakes up to a margin call of $32,000 because RH doesn't calculate options right after hours. Fortunately, he knows he's not actually in a margin call and doesn't panic and merely executes his $11.5 call for a $300 gain but loses a day trade (as his account is under the $25,000 day limit. He then closes all his spreads for a profit to avoid a PTD (pattern day trade) bad for around 80-90% of the spread value.

Scenario 7 - he buys the 11.5 C for $2, it continues to rise and he sells the $14 C for S2.5. The stock falls back for a bit and the premium for a strike the following week is $1.25 (my experience is that it's typically a higher strike, but may still be worth it for squeeze situations, I'll pick approximately similar numbers that happened to me during the GME squeeze). It's the $25 C. The price continues to rise so he tries it again and sells only 1 call because he's not missing out like last time and sells the $30 C. The stock spikes to $390, he sells the other $25 C for $37,000 and let's the other spreads get closed because he no longer has to worry about PTD issues.

There's other scenarios, but this should give a good idea of the different risks/rewards. I've experienced scenarios 1-6 so far with GME, AMC, and a host of biotechs, and a couple bankrupt companies, the most common result is 1 or 3

__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 12:51:30 - That's the point of the bond leg. Capital from equity dilution goes straight into the bondholder's account. 

A popular HF trade on AMC is shorting the stock and using the cash to buy bonds. Apes get dunked on two ways.

I'd wait to short the stock until there's some sort of extreme movement. In the near term long is a much better bet.

__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 12:40:03 - Here's what I wrote on Friday on BBBY:

I think apes are regarded and create delusional conspiracy theories to justify holding onto their underwater positions.

But here's what I'm seeing on BBBY:

The SEC report for GME stated the price action was driven initially by shorts closing but after the closings, retail and gamma/delta had caused the run-up to $480. Meaning short interest is important but not the catalyst for what caused the majority of GME's run, only some of it.

All values below are according to ORTEX.

BBBY has an estimated 32.7M shares short. Shares outstanding is 80M, free float shares is 69.5M. So about a 50% SI%.

Of the existing 32.7M shares short, about 20M of them have been opened on days the price of BBBY was below $12.50. Meaning 20M of those shorts are likely currently underwater.

Options chain shows the following OIs:

- 11K of $15C 8/19
- 13.5K of $20C 8/19
- 10K of $30C 8/19
- 10K of $20C 9/16
- 7K of $15C 1/20/23
- 25K of $20C 1/20/23
- 8K of $22C 1/20/23
- 9K of $25C 1/20/23
- 16K of $30C 1/20/23

So ~110K of OI up to $30 equating up to 11M shares.

Probably not as much powder as the original run that GME went on, but more than compared to the original run that AMC went on.

There's a clear difference between BBBY's potential of a squeeze vs GME/AMC who sit at 20%/18% SI%, significantly less shorts underwater, and less primed options chains.

Not saying that anything is guaranteed on BBBY, but it's important to distinguish the differences between the 3 and why this week looked different for all 3.

Hedgies shorted all three of these companies. People can buy all three of them. I think it‚Äôs just normal for people wanting to move on, especially for retail investors who think they missed the opportunity on AMC/GME and want to hop on something new. A lot of people don‚Äôt know how much potential AMC and GME still have, that‚Äôs why they choose BBBY. Not because of some weird conspiracy, that tries to get investors away from your picks.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 13:34:59 - It's interesting to compare the two movements because you can break all these up into two somewhat overlapping groups, DD writers/leaders and people with less knowledge or ability but some understanding who are more like followers. In GME I still see smart people who write clever, well-researched DD. In AMC I only see the followers and I think the leaders have nothing to offer except calling people shills (projection) and trying to deflect heat from the strong arguments against investing in AMC (Ape no fight ape), or trying to associate themselves with GME with the aid of the financial media.

I'm saying that from Mar-Jun '21 the people who were short AMC, got long (We know names like Citadel, Susquehanna, Jane St. and ultimately BoA but honestly it doesn't matter.) Now they benefit from some upside movement when the memes go up which allows them to have more collateral for their short positions in GME and BBBY. This is not a reason to be in AMC. The correlation will break at the critical moment.

I guess just pick your poison carefully. I'm for GME and BBBY, I was in BB but I'm out of that, and I'm against AMC (I don't hold a short position, but I'm willing to open one if it pops up). In the same way you may be for or against specific stocks a hedge fund will do far more analysis than you or I and make their choices. It is extremely rare for them to have as much exposure as they did with GME on a single stock, but I guess we will see with BBBY. I hope it all plays out the same.

Besides that, when GME squoze, it reached a market cap of $36B. When AMC squoze, it reached a market cap of $33B. BBBY's market cap is just above $1B currently. If it does what both GME and AMC did and reaches a market cap of \~$30B, the stock goes to $375.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 19:46:26 - Take it from an actual retard that dumped 60k into AMC at $15 and sold at $32; sell at your price point, set up a stop loss and DO NOT discover options. That 116k that I made turned into 17k in the span of a month.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 19:00:06 - Last chance to sell AMC and GME and get into bbby

Imagine still believing those two have shorts underwater after a year, and AMC getting diluted next Monday. When you could be up 30% today alone.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 20:37:43 - Your strategy is incomplete.   You sell the kidney for $150K.   Buy all the remaining shares.   Hold them.   GME goes to the moon.  Then you sell them for a bazillion‚Ä¶. And you buy a kidney transplant for $500k‚Ä¶ get your own kidney back and pocket all the profit to invest in BBBY or AMC.

__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 20:15:23 - Mate look at the volumes - no one is selling GME  - maybe AMC is having a small sell off due the APE-dilution FUD
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 20:15:26 - FUD‚Ä¶. All this GME and AMC apes selling for BBBy is just your unproven opinion;thus, this is FUD.
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 20:10:29 - Very true both GME and AMC traded under average volume
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 20:01:21 - AMC to the moon

WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 20:01:00 - Love the FUD‚Ä¶ we ain‚Äôt fucking selling . Now does the pillowfight stonk have a potential to squeeze sure. Does that mean we sell AMC to buy in? What are you crazy ü§£ Apes know we have hedgies shitting bricks with our #APE dividend about to hit. Fuck the FUD buy and HODL and if you are for alittle risk then place some calls expiring in Jan 2023 ‚Ä¶. Fuck you Mayo fuck you Cramer! See you beautiful apes on the moon
__________________________","WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 21:54:04 - Happy to see all the comments confirming you are wrong. No one is selling GME or AMC
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 21:54:08 - This applies to AMC too. Think of meme stocks like balloons.

If you lined up each of the memes next to each other, GME would be the second largest balloon with the most air possible in it.

AMC would be the biggest balloon with the second most amount of air in it.


BBBY, VERY SMALL BALLOON with TONS of air pumping into it.  Hence Cramers comment to ‚Äúrelease more shares‚Äù or better said, make the balloon bigger so short positions locate shares to cover their short positions before WSB runs this fucking thing to the moon.

I was there 24 hours around the clock and in discord and what I saw was by far one of the craziest things I think I have ever witnessed.  140% short GME was and in my time trading, I never once saw the volume explode the way GME did. 

Wall Street Bets stormed the gates of Wall Street that day giving raise and power back to retail investors.

Every stock you buy of GME/AMC/BBBY is a mid section blow to their decades of fortunes they‚Äôve robbed from the working class.

Ain‚Äôt nobody selling, if anything AMC holders is selling, grass, dick, and ass to buy more!  Ultimately no hate I hope we all get rich when this is all over.
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 21:51:27 - I sold 50% of my AMC and bought BBBY with it when I saw that post earlier. The timing paid off perfectly.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 21:50:25 - Buy GME & AMC. NFA.
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 21:44:58 - Lol no they are not. Shorts are getting burned across the board right now. BBBY & GME & AMC are all running strong.
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 21:42:33 - Gme went up like 20x after it dipped like it did last week. AMC went up 10x in the same senario. Bbby has more attention I think than AMC. If it went up 10x from that $13 mark than I can see it hitting $130 but that‚Äôs my opinion. People might sell though if it hits $80 cause of Ryan cohens options.
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 21:39:38 - Imagine how high BBBY would rocket if everyone sold their TSLA / AMC / GME / BTC to buy more BBBY
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 21:24:54 - Well at list they were right about selling AMC
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 21:22:15 - It's cute cuz he thinks people care. And he's hoping his fans jump out of AMC too and follow him into other plays.

To the fucking moon, gentlemen.
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 21:59:52 - Shorts were opened on AMC and shit like this is being posted because they are trying to ""claim"" that Apes are selling so they can further manipulate WSB sentiment.

Don't fall for it!
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 21:59:56 - I'm full tilt into AMC. As mentioned here, no way we're selling. We're not after small fry gains - we're after the immensely risky moon shot.

If anything I'll invest loose change in BBBY momentum and cash out small wins to buy more AMC
__________________________","WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 23:56:19 - We got the perfect storm of memes here. Corn bro who are still suffering the corn winter (majority of them are still underwater bagholding), GME bang bros most are either brake even or still heavily down and not to mention AMC apes. 

They see BBBY as the next GME price rocket action and there's gonna be a whole lotta retailer mom and pop buy action juicing this stock faster and stronger then your Mr. Olympia competition.

__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 23:24:17 - Wealthsimple has officially eliminated the sell button until after the APE shares are issued, many people just got an email. Stating it is for the well being of the investor, and ""Ahead of AMC‚Äôs upcoming Special Dividend, we have updated our DRS withdrawal process in the best interest of our clients. We did this because if any shares are in-transit between Wealthsimple and the transfer agent during the record date, it could cause delays in the shareholder receiving the Special Dividend. To prevent this, Wealthsimple will temporarily stop processing all AMC DRS withdrawals from Friday, August 12th, up until Wednesday, August 24th. All pending AMC DRS withdrawal requests will resume processing again on Thursday, August 25th."" It was asked if this was legal and this was the answer ""Wealthsimple is a Canadian Financial Institution, which means we are governed by the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC). We are abiding by IIROC‚Äôs rules and meeting our fiduciary duty of serving our client‚Äôs best interests in order to ensure that no shares are in transit between Wealthsimple and the transfer agent during the record date of the corporate action taking place with your shares.""

Even when gme was something 20$ i didn't buy it either also.

Then brought instead AMC at 18$.

Next 2 day it went from 18$ to 5$.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-16 06:20:36 - Yep, AMC will be halved according to AA when APE comes out on 1 to 1 ratio and he still got 4.5B left so imagine what AMC will be when it's 10 to 1.

He doesn't need our approval to dump all 5B APE on the market. 

No options chain? Why? What's preventing it? Who will be buying up the 4.5B APE?

APE will have voting rights. Are we able to buy all that up to retain retail control? 

These are questions that need to be answered.

2. maybe to tell people not to fomo and take profits and ride house money is correct but bbby ryan cohen is only reason why we at gme are giving this our blessing and not saying its a distraction pump and dump like the rest.  GOOD tactic by HF but we are not selling GME for BBBY we instead will be using BBBY funds to buy more GME.  I do hope HF shills on WSB understand that.   
3. Some shills on youtube spamming people selling AMC and GME to buy BBBY now perhaps AMC but GME OBV is still 6.07 billion up instead of down.
4. As for BBBY be a nice mistress.  you can be number 2 behind the main if you remain loyal.  backstab us and we will instantly go to gme and create moass and we know GME is the bigger threat to you all. Thanks HF the DRS of GME total shares outstanding is still on the table.

How often does a BBBY happen in the meme stocks world?  
  
If this is of the GME and AMC variety, I think I'm in. If this is something that happens every quarter then maybe give a few examples of stocks that have done this.

But anyone making fun of GME Apes? Line too far to you apparantly.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 00:00:37 - It does seem like this is just the beginning.  BBBY is not even in the top 100 on Robinhood. AMC is #7; GME  is around #36.  So retail is just now starting to pile in.  WISH is on top 100, other similar-size market cap companies too like CLOV, GOPRO.  So it is not size.  BBBY has a ways to run.

__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 02:18:45 - That‚Äôs facts.  Look at after market, all positive, barely tickled negative.

Plus that Nuke end of day hit the entire market, not just BBBY.  Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla, Apple all had a dip right around the same time.

I think the morning spike with GME and AMC was a short fund getting margin called when BBBY moonshot 22->28 and the afternoon spike was a selloff market wide for collateral (amzn, Appl, msft‚Ä¶) and shake out paper hands (bbby, GME, amc, and if you know you know‚Ä¶.APRN)

WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 02:11:53 - Last year people pumped AMCX (TV) when they ment to buy AMC(THEATER). FOMO makes semi retards go full retard. This was before AMC reached high 60's
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 02:09:28 - It seems like a major stretch.  For example if BBBY went 10x to 13.3B (not unreasonable), then GME would have to become a 130B co.   Not happening in my opinion.   There is just more upside with BBBY.   If even a tiny portion of GME and AMC investors arrive, it‚Äôs really a moonshot.

__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 01:59:43 - Anyway, it wouldn‚Äôt hurt you if you are honest with these apes, for someone to gain a lot have to lose, so tell them that 80% of them are going to lose their money for the other 20% apes to make money. btw thank you for the insult, üòÖüòÖüòÖyeah that‚Äôs a tough loss. But anyway I literally used to make $1000 gains on options daily while masturbating when the market opens, I would set the trades earlier, look at my gains cashing while holding my meat. But life is apes vs logic and math, you lose. Who is the winner? Well logic prevails at the end. I don‚Äôt care man, GME is a trash company and needs to get wiped, AMC is literally beyond low in comparison to third world countries movie theatres, BBBY omg the crap. And many apes lost lost in GME, while roaringpity cashed their gains. Green charts are not gains until you cash out, and the moment you cash out, someone else cash in and loses big time. And let me tell you, it ain‚Äôt wallstreet that‚Äôs losing, it‚Äôs apes vs apes. The ape who is selfish first and cash out wipes the ape who waits and relies on trust and this whole memes facade.

During the AMD days (and earlier) even if you didn‚Äôt take positions you‚Äôd join in on the fun and make fun of others with memes and shit but actually rooted for others here to make money.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 04:32:27 - Only sell on a pump when the price contains a 7. 
I sold at $19 instead of waiting for either $17 or $27. It was a lesson I should have learned when AMC hit $70, GME hit $417, and when Rocket hit $27.
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 04:30:59 - Personally I fell it has a potential to be a very long play like GME. I don't think it's going to moon overnight but its definitely going much higher than current levels. Unless the management gets greedy and decides to issue new stock like in case of AMC. If AMC didn't do that it would have gone way past 70ies and stayed above it for long time like GME.

__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 04:23:05 - Great way to learn too.  Obviously this play will act differently than GME (actually it seems pretty similar) and AMC, but you‚Äôll have a bit of skin in the game and get a feel for the rollercoaster of emotions, on $20.  Learn enough and apply it to your YOLO next time around

WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 04:20:16 - In a sane world GME and AMC would have gone bankrupt, BBBY would have slowly gone the way of Sears.

But clown world ape memes saved all 3 companies.

Such is life.

__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 04:16:01 - Hard to say really. I buy into the potential that BBBY might join GME and AMC to become the Big Three, but I don‚Äôt know if that might dilute AMC and GME a little bit. Or maybe it works in the opposite direction given the surprising resilience of meme stocks, and this ends up being even more proof of the power of organized retail traders.
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 04:15:29 - Ur getting down voted but ur right. It's everyman for himself when the ball drops again just like GME

It's a meme stock.

An undervalued meme stock if that can be considered a thing LOL

My reason for saying this is that both AMC and GME have Market Caps of 12 billion while BBBY has a marketcap of only 2 billion

Only one side stands a chance of coming out wealthy here, and news flash, they were wealthy to begin with too.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 04:04:42 - This guys owns 53% of the company now which was trading close to cash value yesterday. They did a $124m in revenue just last quarter so close to $500m for the year. How is the market cap near $140m yesterday, which was almost their cash on hand of $134m. This has a high squeeze written all over it. 

1. 9.1m share only in float vs 69m in BBBY
2. Low market cap
3. New partnership with Walmart announced end on June. 
4. Low price
5. 55% shares short. Higher than BBBY, GME, AMC, etc. 

Good luck.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 05:46:04 - I have a question guys and its a real nooby. I have come into a compensation settlement. If I put 15k into BBBY, how long do i keep it there until the short squeeze like AMC and the hedgefunds get liqidated or hurt? Am I on the wrong path? I can afford to lose that much but I don't intend to make much either. If I put it in and it affects the wall street bankers than I am okay with getting the same vack or losing a little. I just want to help the cause but I need to know the date that it happens so I can keep it in there that long.
Is there still a cause? Or are you guys just investing? If there is no short squeeze or liquidating of big money, I will just do something else like giving my kids babysitter a pay rise.

__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 06:05:53 - Agreed! I also feel like they have wayyyy more eyes on them this go around, so their fuckery won't be as bad as we saw with GME or AMC. I mean hell Robinhood has some serious lawsuit against them and Congress did an investigation last time (I'm sure eventually it'll play a small role in some sort of new legislation). We're primed better than GME was the first go around. Especially now that people have actually seen what can happen. I expect major swings if course, but I do be believe the run up for BBBY will be much faster comparatively. Now idk to what price, but I'd say $100+ is pretty fucking realistic bro, maybe even into the $200-$500 range. Shit can't go to $1,000,000 obviously, but it CAN get high as hell üòÇ

__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 09:36:52 - For the record, 
I bought AMC in Jan 2021. In the beginning I bought at less than $4 and added as it went up averaging up my position each time. 
Watched it go to 72 and back down. Diamond handed or so I told myself. 
Looking back, I wish I sold at least half at 60-72 or trimmed as it went up. But I told myself it would go higher. 
I began trimming my position when it dropped below 40. I held a large portion of my shares to 14 and sold. 
I held for over a year and a half. 
I had plenty opportunity to take the green Infront of me. 
But greed and listening to others pump the diamond hand motto and my own ignorance let the opportunity to make a good chunk of cash slip through my fingers. 
I still left green, but I could have been greener. 

Hence me saying you do you.

We have a lot of cult stocks. Tesla (deservedly so), GME, AMC, can the market hold a cult up for a a place to buy bath towels and seasonal scented candles?

WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 20:43:37 - So for those from r/all wondering what's up with BBBY here's the low down: 

Bed Bath and Beyond is shorted to oblivion like GameStop was (is), and the people who did the shorting are finding themselves even more underwater this time.

So the bad guys (short hedge funds) used mass media to bring attention to the stock along with GameStop and AMC, and today, after hours when retail trader where out of the game, they shorted all three into the ground. 

So now they have survived another day but they are deeper underwater, and they can only kick the can so far.

And that's not even the tip of the iceberg. All because a bunch of degenerates outsmarted wall street and are putting a wedge between the criminals and their criminal means.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

Student makes $110mn trading meme stock favourite Bed Bath & Beyond

https://www.ft.com/content/1b21bb08-6590-49c6-8baa-5ad8c527fbcc

A 20-year-old university student has made a roughly $110mn gain by selling a stake in struggling retailer Bed Bath & Beyond, after its stock price soared during a month of frenzied trading reminiscent of last year‚Äôs meme stock boom.
Jake Freeman, an applied mathematics and economics major at the University of Southern California, acquired nearly 5mn shares in Bed Bath & Beyond in July, according to regulatory filings, after dismal earnings and the ousting of its chief executive sent its stock price plummeting.
Freemen bought his stake at under $5.50 a share. On Tuesday, Bed Bath & Beyond surged to more than $27 a share. As the stock soared, Freeman sold more than $130mn worth of stock from his TD Ameritrade and Interactive Brokers accounts.

‚ÄúI certainly did not expect such a vicious rally upwards,‚Äù Freeman said in an interview on Wednesday. ‚ÄúI thought this was going to be a six months plus play‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚ÄâI was really shocked that it went up so fast.‚Äù

After selling the shares, Freeman went for dinner with his parents in the suburb of New York City where they live and on Wednesday he flew to Los Angeles to return to campus, he said.

Freeman amassed his more than 6 per cent position via Freeman Capital Management, a fund registered in the cowboy town of Sheridan, Wyoming, according to the filings. He said he raised money from friends and family and believed the ailing company could restructure its debt.
Upon disclosing his position in July, Freeman sent an uncompromising message to the retailer‚Äôs board. The company, he said, was ‚Äúfacing an existential crisis for its survival‚Äù. It needed ‚Äúto cut its cash-burn rate, drastically improve its capital structure, and raise cash‚Äù, he added.

Shares of the New Jersey-based chain ‚Äî known for operating cavernous stores full of vacuums, towels and kitchen gadgets ‚Äî have risen fivefold over the past month even after the grim earnings report on June 29.
It reported sales had plunged by 25 per cent in the second quarter compared to the same period of 2021 while its net loss widened to $358mn from $51mn. Its cash position had dwindled to $107mn from $1bn at the start of the year.

Bed Bath & Beyond is one of a handful of meme stocks that became popular at the start of 2021 but has garnered less attention than GameStop, the video game retailer, and AMC, the cinema chain.
The increase in its share price has been driven by interest from retail investors attracted by the stock‚Äôs small free float and a significant number of short sellers betting the share price will fall.

Those two characteristics tend to draw interest from retail investors frequenting Reddit forums. It means they can try to engineer a ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù by driving the share price higher and forcing professional investors to unwind their bearish positions, which only propels the stock even higher.

Freeman‚Äôs sale was well-timed. Shares of Bed Bath & Beyond fell by 17 per cent in after-hours trading on Wednesday after Ryan Cohen, GameStop chair and a large shareholder of the homeware retailer, disclosed he is planning to sell his entire stake of almost 12 per cent in the company.

It was a separate disclosure on Monday from Cohen, co-founder of pet food retailer Chewy and a meme-stock champion, that sent the stock on a tear on Tuesday. He disclosed he had purchased a large number of call options in Bed Bath & Beyond ‚Äî derivatives that can deliver a windfall if a stock rises in value.

Cohen did not respond to a request for comment.

Hopefully some of you remembered to take profits this time.

__________________________","WSB - Posted @2022-08-18 00:52:00 - Update, RC take and $$$ requested.  Two out of three isn‚Äôt bad. 

Update : I‚Äôm still all in.   +4,000 shares.  174,000 / 10C 1/23

4.3M total  üê≥üíé

But that‚Äôs not the main question, right? 

Is RC in?  That is more difficult to answer, lavender hearts notwithstanding.   

To quickly address the stock performance itself.  My personal pre-week projections/notes called for all days of double digit days and one red day, either Wed or Thursday.   We‚Äôre on schedule. The reaction to the down day would what determined if Friday is a double digit or triple digit gain day, and if the latter, all bets are off for Mon open. (üöÄ)   I debated trying to time either Wed or Thursday and make moves accordingly , and decided not to.   If I chose wrong it would be too expensive to get back in Friday.  Tomorrow may be the last buying opportunity for shorts and retail on the sidelines (GME and AMC holders, that is) [Someone please make a Gandalf meme with ‚ÄúOn the 5th day look to my coming from the East!].  Regardless, it will be a big EOW.  

(No need to even waste this space, but yes, the media is blatantly disingenuous and their interests obviously align with the shorts.  CLICKS and NEGATIVES at any cost.   There is no truth premium, sorry.   To be honest, that‚Äôs a bullish signal to me.  It‚Äôs yet another sign of desperation and everything will be thrown at retail tomorrow to induce sales.   It really will be a battlefield.  They have to make enough tomorrow not to get slaughtered by the bulls Friday/Mon.  My take is that they will lose.  The volume and buy in is too high.  There are too many watching on the sidelines frustrated that they won‚Äôt get a shot at 8/19.)

Back to RC. 

What is in his best interest?  Cut his losses and move on?  Disassociate from meme stocks and his base of support?  High Society Wall Street and take a position in Apple and push for pet wearables? (Hey that might actually be genius).  Perhaps.   

However, if he makes the jump from Papa Cohen to Papa Paper Hands, it‚Äôs curtains for his reputation.  He has a pristine track record and reputation, pretty much the perfect assets for a billionaire activist investor.   Why did so many people follow him here to BBBY?   That‚Äôs why.  The $100-180m or so from sales is kind of small in comparison to the potential billions wiped out of his future positions.  

Let‚Äôs consider the OG Chewy RC for a moment rather than GME Chairman RC.   His genius/innovation was on a new way to retail with an incredible focus on customer service, experience etc.   Basically, taking an anti-Amazon position that ‚Äúlife is a vending machine, push button, get cheap product‚Äù.   It also helped that he had slightly irrational customers (pet owners) that could pay a premium.   

Enter BBBY and (unmentioned in the media coverage today) buybuy Baby.   The second great group of irrational customers : parents.    (I speak for myself incidentally.   Any stock losses cannot compare with the present and future amount happily wasted/spent on our two dogs and two babies.)  It‚Äôs a perfect match for his skill set - Retail that needs a shakeup and better customer service to cater to parents (okay, probably moms - don‚Äôt cancel me. I‚Äôm a dad and have been to BBBY too, ok?).   So people liked his chances.  Fair enough.   There was some over buying of inventory (same as literally every retailer) and the stock dropped.  Okay, that‚Äôs the not problem. 

The problem would be if RC tries essentially nothing, fails and quickly jumps ship.   Reputation gone.  Game over and literally GME over too.  Magic gone forever.  Everything build up - track record, following- all gone for millions rather than billions.  These BBBY 60, 70, 80C‚Äôs were just a bs signaling of hubris and a supernatural return to record highs based on just showing up.   Yup, Papa Cohen got high on his own supply.  

Does that all really add up ?   Or ‚Ä¶. ?


One more possibility.  My working thesis and why I entered this position at all.  I believe that in the next 10 days (possibly even 8/19) that the sale of buybuy Baby will be announced.   I think a deal has been reached.   That was always his play and it‚Äôs a legitimate one.  I don‚Äôt know the numbers or have inside info, it‚Äôs just what I think.    It makes a lot of sense.   RC is smart, strategic and sequential.   This filing is first, perception negative.  (Reality unknown). Sale announced, positive.   I honestly thought it could be a spin off, but this reads like a sale.  Just in time for the post-pandemic baby boom.  The jewel in the crown sold at the right time and mission accomplished.  Thank you, Papa. 

Incidentally (lol at Cramer), his filing (and potential sale, whether it happens or not) this pretty much guarantees dilution will NOT occur in the next 90 days.  Period.   Interm CEO stays for now, replaced thereafter.  Fresh start.   But honestly who cares about that ?  

If and when the sale of buybuy Baby is announced, the rocket ship takes off again and RC exits leaving cash in BBBY with the MOASS as a parting gift.  And on to the next one.  

Some stories do have a happy end.   

Calling all GME and AMC bros, you‚Äôre welcome to the BBBY happy ending, you degenerates.  

Conclusion : üê≥üíé ü¶çüí™,  üêªü§°‚ùå

WSB - Posted @2022-08-18 00:19:55 - After they turned off the buy button and allowed closing of positions thereby removing much of the buying pressure it was a sign that it might have been the top. But in reality it was never very clear at the time.

With BBBY... today reminds me of the week before GME really went nuts with people like Andrew Left (Citron) coming out with bear DD on GME and lots of ""big boys"" telling everyone this is nuts and you will lose money. I don't remember exactly how things traded but I do recall up to Friday was not making much money, but then positions held over the weekend the following week went crazy till the brokers and clearing houses placed restrictions.

Truth is, I really have zero idea where BBBY goes from here. It is very fast moving and hard to tell if we topped or are just at the bottom. I would compare market  cap of GME, AMC, and BBBY and it seems obvious that simply on the power of retail investor movement alone this still has plenty to go, but then again, do people stick with it to run it up or are people going to abandon ship first.

They can sell divisions including Buy buy baby. Net asset of the sale is worth more than the MC today.

Plus at a higher valuation they can raise funds by issuing shares - hence the AMC strategy

Look at the squeezes last year with gme and AMC. Whatever you do, don't expect to hit gme level of returns or probably not even AMC when it hit 70 last June. Don't get left holding the bag like these gme and AMC guys. Holding for 18+ months and still waiting for a ""moass"" get in and get out. Make money.

No one is walking into a Bed Bath and Beyond and handing the girl behind the counter a hundred dollar bill and saying thank you, we got you. People aren‚Äôt bringing food to the employees and saying thank you, we got you. Outside of Reddit and a few people on CNBC, most still don‚Äôt know about BBBY. GME was an event. A fucking EVENT. It was on another level. Once in a lifetime and we almost got it a second time when it squeezed a couple of months later. Literally had Deep Value testifying about it. The stock was shorted over 100%. An entire company went bankrupt betting against it. There‚Äôs no fucking comparison. None. This is the same bullshit the AMC kids try to say. There‚Äôs no fucking comparison. GME was a once in a lifetime squeeze. Nothing has come close.

Almost every ticker paraded around here since GME has pumped before dumping, and there's definitely money to be made. I managed to make money on CLOV, AMC, BBBY, dip in and out of CLF and UWMC for like $20 in losses, and am currently bagholding OPAD at a 90% loss as a constant reminder.

Party City actually produces profit. Even GME has not done that for a long time.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-18 07:48:14 - Look man I never got into GME but I was ALL in on AMC and made a fat stack of cash, but the CEO just kept doing shit that actively worked against the share price. Diluting, selling personal shares after claiming he wouldn't, not paying down debt with new money, buying a dying mining company (actually stupid), there's plenty of examples. I really did hope the best for it, and it could still grow a little bit, But there are too many insiders scalping the company left and right. If you wanted more gains you'd probably be better off with anyone if the other ""meme stocks"". GME and BBBY seem to have the most potential right now, plus if your into weed stocks there's the midterm elections (US) coming in November and they always pop around then.

Also you can make a killing swing trading AMC between $10-$20. You can damn near set your watch to it.

Short squeeze ahead! This is how high the bets are against Bed Bath & Beyond, Gamestop and AMC.

Short-sellers are making big losses on their bets against U.S. retail investors' favorite stocks. As a result, prices could rise even further.

Bed Bath & Beyond's stock continues its sensational rally. On Thursday, the share price rises by another 20 percent. But this does not have to be the end, shows a study by the analysis firm S3 Partners.The reason is short sellers who were surprised by the rally. Instead of earning money with falling prices, they lose some due to the rising prices - almost 700 million dollars in August alone.And it's not just Bed Bath & Beyond, but also AMC Entertainment and Gamestop where short-sellers are coming under pressure. That, in turn, is affecting the companies' stock prices: Betting on losses could push them even higher.**Bed Bath & Beyond: short ratio of 55.23 percent**The retailer is one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street. Since the beginning of July, Bed Bath & Beyond has risen by more than 300 percent, going up 14 times in the past 15 trading days.The stock is in demand primarily because many professional and private investors are expecting a short squeeze. This is the term for a sudden rise in the share price, because short-sellers who have bet on falling prices have to end their bets.The mechanism behind this is as follows: short sellers borrow shares for bets on falling prices and sell them immediately. They are betting that they will be able to buy back the shares at a lower price before the return date. But if prices rise, they have to buy back the shares into the rising market to end the bets. By doing so, they drive the rally even further.The more stocks are shorted, the more massive such a short squeeze can theoretically be - and in the case of Bed Bath & Beyond, the short ratio is particularly high, data from S3 Partners show: 55.23 percent of freely tradable shares are shorted.""We have seen an increase in short bets, even though Bed Bath & Beyond's share price has risen sharply recently,"" explains Ihor Dusaniwsky, an analyst at S3 Partners. ""That doesn't mean there hasn't been a short squeeze. Many short-sellers had to reduce or close out their positions because of the large losses. But they were replaced.""

**We expect the short squeeze in Bed Bath & Beyond to continue.Ihor Dusanwisky, analyst at S3 Partners**

So while short-sellers who have been betting against Bed Bath & Beyond for some time ended their bets after the stock successively cracked the ten, 15 and 20 dollar marks, there are new short-sellers who see these levels as an attractive entry point to bet on falling prices.In the past 30 days, short-sellers opened new short bets against 5.45 million shares worth $113 million, according to S3. That represents a 19 percent increase in short bets. Last week alone, there were 1.67 million shares.Dusaniwsky, however, is skeptical that the losing bets will pan out this time: ""We expect the short squeeze in Bed Bath & Beyond to continue.""**AMC Entertainment: short ratio of 17.85 percent**The movie theater operator was one of the favorite stocks of so-called Reddit traders last year. That's the term for retail investors who discuss stocks on the online forum of the same name. In the spring and summer of 2021, AMC shares each experienced price rallies with gains of several hundred percent.Now AMC prices are rising again - not as strongly as last year, but short-sellers are playing a role here, too, Dusaniwsky explains. ""The AMC short squeeze is still strong, with bets against 4.10 million shares terminated in the last 30 days. That was a 4.3 percent drop in shorted shares, while the stock price rose 61 percent."" In August alone, short-sellers made a loss of nearly $900 million so far.At last count, 17.85 percent of shares were still shorted. Dusaniwsky expects the short-squeeze in AMC to continue as long as the stock remains at its current level of over $20: ""Short-sellers still have $1.1 billion in year-to-date profits and will reduce their positions to realize the gains they have left.""**Gamestop: short ratio of 22.59 percent**Gamestop is one of the best-known examples of a short squeeze. Last year, the computer game retailer had more than 140 percent of its shares shorted before retail investors coordinated on Reddit and pushed the short-sellers out of the market. That short level was never reached again, but the current level of 22.59 percent is still high.Most recently, short-sellers pulled back: while the stock rose 19 percent in 30 days, 1.92 million shares (3.2 percent) saw bets closed on falling prices.

Dusaniwsky counts Gamestop among the short-squeeze candidates: ""Short-sellers with less conviction or staying power will continue to exit or reduce their bets."" At the same time, the analyst cautions, ""But if the trend in the stock price reverses, you can be sure that short-sellers will reappear and open new bets.""

I was there 2 years ago when we had the fight of our lives, it was crazy, the discord went crazy and all my friends went crazy. We had the upper hand and the stock market was starting to do something which it so seldom does, we retails and apes were in control, NOT THE INSTITUTIONS!  Then they did the unforgivable, they fucking removed the buy button?!??!? A MOVE THAT IS FUCKING ILLEGAL. 

This time they can't do it and even if they were to try we will be ready with 15 different brokers to buy and hold!!! This time we will win, we will fucking win!!! üêµüêµüöÄüöÄüöÄ

GME on the other hand, while it did sting that I bought near the top and lost a few thousand, I kept most of my small shares and held all the way through the stock split. Seeing so much green on Wednesday from not only BBBY but GME also, shit was fire yo.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-18 11:36:11 - Same. I had close to 1500 shares of AMC @ around $15.50 cost basis, it kept going down and I thought it was over, sold @ $9.15. Missed out on over $100k, been kicking myself ever since.

At worst I'm risking a 10% loss, and at best I'll increase my capital by +30% +40% in the next 30 to 60 days...

WSB - Posted @2022-08-18 12:11:07 - Nobody shorted anything into the dirt in these cases. GME, AMC, BBBY were all failing on their own. They're not successful companies and created their own sittuations. Somebody saw an opportunity to cash in on that failure in the opposite way and struck by spreading that around social media. Then he cashed out and ran. Then an activist investor saw an opportunity with social media sentiment to cash in millions off dying companies before eventually bailing out just like with chewy. By all means, take your money and run. But there's no moral high ground to be had here or moral war to win. It's manipulation fighting manipulation. Call it what it is and cash in when you can.

__________________________","WSB - Posted @2022-08-18 13:59:37 - For anyone that bought calls or stock after $GME already went parabolic, it resulted in life changing ***losses***, not gains. I don't pity anyone that buys ***after*** the play is had.

Most traders that FOMO'd short squeeze plays like $GME or $AMC ***lost*** life changing amounts of money.

There are always more losers than winners in this game...and it's an individual sport.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-18 14:54:59 - Yes then as gme was mooning in january, some brokers limited the amount you could buy or stopped the buying. For example with ameritrade if you owned 50 shares or more you could not buy more even not on margin. If you had less you could buy up to 50. At the same time AMC you could have up to 500 unless you prevously had them before the buy button was restricted! Ameritrade had 50 plus stocks on a restricted buy list. All this others may not know when all they heard was robinhood stopped the buying of gme but this wemt way further than one brokerage! It wasnt said how many brokers had so many on the list or if there were lists. The thing is i got curous because this was the time i found out about 0 commission trading and then was unable to buy these in the quantities i wanted at times so looked up the list of restricted stocks and it was huge!!!! So i think this time they cant get away with stopping the buying but not sure about the restricting to limits if you dont already have them!

Just rmr he has options expiring 2023 with a strike price of 80, hold at least until then and for now DCA into dips, if you feel so inclined. I look at meme stocks like crypto honestly, the volatility is a part of it you just have to not get dettered.

But one thing for each real share I have checked with my broker that all of mine are ligit a ape is issued that means we will know and wallstreet will know how many fake shares there are and the paper trail will lead back to the culprit. Or will a re evaluation of the amc stock take place increasing the value are the rate of if those share where bought before the time of selling? 

What I will say to all AMC ape strap in guys its gona get bumpy
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-18 15:41:57 - > I don't know what will happen on Monday

I expect people will have 1 APE per AMC in their account unless they bought this week, the same way they'd have $1.00 in their account if it was a regular cash dividend. As this is not like GME where it was the same symbol, spinning up a new one gives them plenty of leeway in ""sorry, this takes time"" crap.

Furthermore, because it is not a split, and is on paper valued at $0.01 it *shouldnt* devalue AMC stock, however having it have a theoretical par value (at AMC board discression) means that they'll likely balance out...I'm interested to see if it'll open at $10 on monday (or whatever 50% of closing friday is)

My current BBBY position is still positive but I will say this - I was late to GME, made great money on AMC and a few other plays that I learned about from WSB. I‚Äôve learned a lot here but the one thing that‚Äôs been taught to me by the people on here who are really good at trading is that it takes discipline to be good at this. I‚Äôve made some good plays this year along with some bad ones but I‚Äôm always learning. If BBBY is a bad play then so be it, if it isn‚Äôt then that‚Äôs great. I‚Äôll move on to something else. Right now it‚Äôs still pretty early for me and I‚Äôm just gonna hold my position and try to add more where I can. 

That‚Äôs it.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-18 18:35:05 - >amc is $20.00 the that might be what APE will start at which would be awsome.

Unlikely, you cant just generate value from nothing, or whats stopping any other company from spinning off a new symbol at 100% value every single day for the infinit money glitch?

the synthetic shares also arent a problem, they can be easily generated at whatever level they were originated from. All previously DRSed shares would absolutely get a real share attributed to it and I have yet to see anyone not get their shares...at best they bitch and moan about not getting them immediately, but corporate actions take time. I just went through the IHC/RHC merger and it took a week for me to get my new RHC shares. and those are standard, no fuckery stocks...

The only time they ever become a problem is when the entirety of the company is ""DRSed"" and more shares are attempted. which has never happened...but maybe one day...I'm not here to discuss the merits of that.

AMC will open Monday at about 50% of whatever they close at Friday.

Not in any official way. but in the same way any companies share price will shed the value of the dividend the day after the ex-dividend date once ""anyone holding the shares are no longer entitled to the dividend""

as 1APE=1AMC, it has a floating ""real dollar value"" of ""whatever AMC is worth"" and anyone who would buy 1 AMC Aug 22nd would functionally hold 0.5AMC should they ever convert APEs to AMC shares because they wouldnt get an APE share. Thus...they would only tangibly want to pay 50% of the value of 1AMC+1APE. and seeing as nothing except the magical creation of APEs from thin air happened over the weekend(presumably) then the market will only be willing to pay 50% at open and you'd never truly see $20 AMC and $20APE (to start...fuck knows where this shit will go)

I bet you'll see APE trade with a bit of a discount though because they dont have voting rights and whatnot

I'm also worried about the other 4.8million APEs that AMC is holding onto because sure...they *say* they arent going to do anything with them...but when has that ever stopped a company from doing the thing they said they werent going to IMMEDIATELY AFTER whatever they wanted to have happen happens.

God how many times have we heard ""no no no dont make that policy Mr. Politician, we wouldnt dream of fucking over people, surely you can trust us to be ethical""...and then someone loads up on some shares....they dont make the policy....until next year...

Not making a value judgement either way, but as someone who nearly got screwed on the first big AMC bump, I get it lol.

Justification:  I am not yet in the options plays, so this is just for consideration by those in options.  This morning it was announced that China is pulling 5 state-owned stocks from the NYSE, due to regulations/requirements.  Talking heads were suggesting that Alibaba is probable to be next in line to be removed for the same reasons.  If there is high institutional investment in the NYSE, I'm thinking that it could result in downward pressure.  Note that BABA is down \~3% in pre-market.

Mudrick Capital ruined AMC for me, nothing and no one else influenced that. Mudrick bought 8m shares at $20, and then turned around and sold them at $40 (even as the price climbed well over that). Everyone was distraught, but I commented ""Like drunks in a casino they'll lose it all next week"". And they did, lost all those gains +10% of their total capital. Officially they blamed a 'Out of control bad options play'. But no, they closed their short positions at a loss.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-12 00:37:01 - It depends on the stock, unfortunately. They're all influenced by the indexes on some level, since there's parity and ETF membership consideration at play, but whether they move with the market depends a lot on where the flows are.

What you want to do is look at the stock in question and see if there's some degree of correlation with market movement and conditions, and then consider whether or not the stock is overall beating the market or not.

If you find some correlation and the stock moves down 0.25% on average but the market in a given move goes down 0.50%, for example, but then one the move up the stock elevates with it or higher, the net result of the parity flow will often (not always, again depends on the flow) be to multiply the movement on the meme stock since it compounds.

Looking at BBBY's chart, we don't have a case for strong parity in movement, since the chart does not reflect the macro index charts for SPY or QQQ, but the two peaks this year correspond with big movements in those indexes, in March and now, meaning that the exposure to the market is largely from supporting bullish trends and capital flows.

Watching today I can say for a fact that index flow redirection also reflected in BBBY's price action, with today's peak being at 10:20 Eastern. So I would expect BBBY to be influenced by the larger market trend, yes.

Then when $90k becomes $50k you obviously don't want to sell because you're just missing out on profits.

Especially when other similar projects were hitting above 500 million market cap and some were even pushing into the billions my investment was still well under 100 million.

Sure after taxes that $90k would have cleared my student loans and let me do some home renovations. Then maybe had some left over to reinvest, but $500k+? Would have been all that plus a rental property or enough to throw into a safe ETF. One is really awesome, and one is life changing.

At this point about a year and a half later I've done almost all the stuff I would have done with the $90k, except for about $10k in student loans. You live and you learn ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)

__________________________",,"WSB - Posted @2022-08-14 17:03:21 - Yup, GME was shorted in hopes of a bankruptcy lottery. It hasn‚Äôt been in a long time. It is rarely directly shorted. It‚Äôs been a volatility play since that hedge funds take advantage of retards creating an illiquidity playground for them. Hedge funds circle jerk FTD around using ETF creation to wash shares. Cover at the last minute when they have entropy swaps in place put bomb it at gamma max and profit on all ends of the movement. It‚Äôs not impossible that GME he swaps open that packaged the short position but it‚Äôs almost irrelevant to the possibility of a short term price action.

FOMO is a huge driver of a squeeze. It‚Äôs what made January so volatile. Funds fucked them selves and retail through lighter fluid on it with weeklies. If they had monthlies, mm couldn‚Äôt have dehedged and GME would have actually rocketed. Once they could deleverage from the OTM weekly options, GME tanked. FOMO is scary for market makers. It is a real part of it. The conditions underlying it were caused by institutions and market makers. The FOMO escalates it.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 16:05:15 - Well if you just want things linked, all Meme stocks are linked and are in an ETF, so potentially they all could have positions for and against them but it gets astronomically more complicated. I guess just pick your poison carefully. I'm for GME and BBBY, I was in BB but I'm out of that, and I'm against AMC (I don't hold a short position, but I'm willing to open one if it pops up). In the same way you may be for or against specific stocks a hedge fund will do far more analysis than you or I and make their choices. It is extremely rare for them to have as much exposure as they did with GME on a single stock, but I guess we will see with BBBY. I hope it all plays out the same.

I say XLP puts because every retail store is trying to give away inventory on clearance and can‚Äôt even do that.  Also, Amazon has reported reduced E-commerce traffic, which probably applies to all retail traffic.

Since the ETFs holds millions of shares of BBBY, you avoid the problem of not finding shares to short BBBY.

What I don't get is how this works because ETFs rebalance their portfolio periodically, not in real time.

Or at least acknowledge what you are doing is gambling and don't trick other people into doing the same. There is nothing wrong with playing roulette if you are aware of the reality of the game.

Big changes will be instituted and basic Americans will suffer i e the poorest of us.  The market has claimed many peoples lives and has always been an unachievable way to profit for most of us.  Since our economy is collateralized by the free market, this is extremely dangerous.  Nothing can be assumed.  Blackrock took a huge position in coinbase just a week before the Supreme Court ruled that individual investors could sue the company for the selling of unsanctioned securities.  I smell a fish and worse than that the chaos of the large shortselling institutions will almost undoubtedly prevail.  Cramer said he wouldn't bet against the short sellers and they did stop the buy button before.  To act like this won't happen again is foolish.  On top of that if you look at the institutions that are holding bbby, it is apparent that they have made fortunes off of the demise of alot of companies.  I TRUST THAT THE ONLY REASON BLACKROCK TOOK A POSITION IN COINBASE WAS TO SHORT SELL IT.  WHY IT WENT UP AFTER THE NEWS SEEMS TO ME THAT OTHER SHORT SELLERS ARE ADDING POSITIONS AS WELL.  BE CAREFUL,  PROCEED WITH TREPIDATION.

A person buys and ""owns"" shares of a company, just as they buying ""owning"" a home. There's equity hopefully in both of those. Most can Borrow up to 80% of a home equity and 40-60% of the equity in your shares, TAX FREE, because it's a loan. Take that loan money and start you a small business i.e. Holding bags of poop R us, who cares. Get your business license, tax ID and now, hire your spouse, your kids, hell hire your dog as a guard dog, pay them, obviously the minimum wage. With your at home business you need to lease your business a room, business needs garbage p/u, business needs cell phones, business needs electricity, and vehicles. ect, ect ect.. And the business you've open will probably operate in the negative for the first 3-5 and have no chance of succeeding. So you close it. However, you do have the next business in mind that might be better üòâ.  I'M NOT SAYING I'VE DONE THIS. I JUST HEARD A GUY, TELL A GUY, THAT KNOWS A GUY, THAT USE TO DATE A GIRL, WHO'S PARENTS, PARENTS DID. Or something like that..idk

Yes, they absolutely 100% work.  Like there's no way it could be confused with placebo effect kind of works.  HAVING SAID THAT, don't waste your money on them.  You can buy viagra or cialis without a prescription  on the internet for wayyyyyy less money and those medications work wayyyyyy better than the gas station boner pills.  I know I've tried them all.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 17:12:58 - its a technical term loosely related to a dropout phase during power buy/sell ratio overhang. Once the yield breakout is observed along with volume above 29n we will track a soakout phase meaning shedding of mean spreads to the upside. Once we're done with that a breakout phase will ensue. The yield curve will effectively snap whilse the SMA wrapper can no longer contain the average rally speed. Effectively resulting in an upside to the positive of $80-90...... It really is THAT EASY

IT STATES HE DIDNT SELL THEM NOW, BUT SAYS HE HAS THE OPTION TO SELL THE CONTRACTS OR EXCERCISE THEM BECAUSE OPTIONS ARE LIKE THAT. HE OWNS 10% OF THE COMPANY SO HE HAS TO FILE A 144 DUE TO THE SEC.

__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 20:24:25 - Two days in a row where they dropped the price back down to $18

$10-$12 drop from $28 or daily highs and raised back to $25-$30 premarket

Thats how you control the price without letting the price go higher than $30

THE SQUEEZE IS THERE BUT THEY ARE RUG PULLING AT THE END OF THE DAY WITH SHITTY ASS TACTICS THAT CAUSES A PANIC SELL OR THEY ARE PULLING THE MARKET DOWN WITH IT (YESTERDAY)

__________________________","WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 21:27:21 - Apes we are in the endgame and some of you don‚Äôt even realize it. BBBY was added to the regulation SHO list by the SEC within the last 24 hours. For those who don‚Äôt know what that means: 

Effective January 3, 2005, new short sale rules were implemented, including a uniform ‚Äúlocate‚Äù requirement for short sales in all equity securities and additional requirements for broker-dealers trading securities in which a substantial amount of failures to deliver have occurred (Regulation SHO Threshold Securities). Please refer to Head Trader Alerts #2004-108, #2004-155, #2004-166 and #2004-168.
The SEC amended Regulation SHO to eliminate the ‚Äúgrandfather provision‚Äù effective October 15, 2007. Please refer to Regulatory Alert #2007-086 for complete details.
As announced in General News Item #2005-005, Wednesday, April 13, 2005, was the last day that Nasdaq posted a separate addendum to the Threshold List in order to identify the additional OTC securities subject to Regulation SHO.

They just released the news that Cohen signed the paperwork necessary as an insider to be able to sell his position. He has 90 days to exercise that AND HE HAS NOT DONE THAT. He knows the hedgies are more fucked than bears right now and he wants to be able to sell when we are floating around Jupiter. If it‚Äôs true that the float is over 100% short due to naked shorts then the moonshot is going to be even more spectacular. 

GME went down 11% between jan 14 and 15 only to squeeze the following week. These stupid cucks are doing everything they possibly can to save themselves but we are stronger together than they ever will be apes. So you know what to do. Buy it at that sweet sweet discount and let‚Äôs all make it to the promised land. 

This is not financial advice*

Then they did the unforgivable, they fucking removed the buy button?!??!? A MOVE THAT IS FUCKING ILLEGAL.

__________________________","WSB - Posted @2022-08-18 12:33:14 - Is that a serious question?  

A coordinated effort by large money funds with influence over MSM orchestrates a flood of 2 DTE put purchasing in concert with the release of SEC documents that are outwardly bad looking because 90% of retail traders are dumbasses who don't read fine print - let alone understand securities law. All conveniently taking place at the same time with the same narrative being pushed over all financial media outlets.  THAT is crime.  THAT is market manipulation at its finest.  To top it off - at the same time as puts were being purchased in enormous numbers, one or more funds were actively flooding the market with 5.6 million, almost certainly borrowed/shorted, shares which crashed the price 14%+ and then they immediately covered back about 2.5 million shares just minutes later to lock in tens of millions of dollars worth of gains just a few minutes later. 

Shit's unreal how disgusting it is.  These people need to be buried under the jails.  They manipulate markets daily, pay off their cronies in the media as a cost of doing business with no threat of consequence then blame everything on the little guy.

This rally is a joke but could have legs and I learned my lesson in June 2020, so playing this mostly cash and a few high conviction plays (mostly LEAP index puts minus the TSLA bet). Doubled down on QQQ Jan $300p today.

__________________________","WSB - Posted @2022-08-12 00:37:01 - It depends on the stock, unfortunately. They're all influenced by the indexes on some level, since there's parity and ETF membership consideration at play, but whether they move with the market depends a lot on where the flows are.

What you want to do is look at the stock in question and see if there's some degree of correlation with market movement and conditions, and then consider whether or not the stock is overall beating the market or not.

If you find some correlation and the stock moves down 0.25% on average but the market in a given move goes down 0.50%, for example, but then one the move up the stock elevates with it or higher, the net result of the parity flow will often (not always, again depends on the flow) be to multiply the movement on the meme stock since it compounds.

Looking at BBBY's chart, we don't have a case for strong parity in movement, since the chart does not reflect the macro index charts for SPY or QQQ, but the two peaks this year correspond with big movements in those indexes, in March and now, meaning that the exposure to the market is largely from supporting bullish trends and capital flows.

Watching today I can say for a fact that index flow redirection also reflected in BBBY's price action, with today's peak being at 10:20 Eastern. So I would expect BBBY to be influenced by the larger market trend, yes.

More and more people are piling into shorts the higher we go. Conventional logic would say to short but there's not going to be a mean reversion or sustained downside reversal with infinite covering. Think of all the money on the sidelines praying for a pullback to buy in. Just throw a dart and buy ITM call leaps. Set and forget. The bond market is already pricing in rate cuts in early 2023. A short covering rally will get so high that at some point it evolves into a new bull market. 90% of SPX stocks are now above the 20 SMA

All are overbought, IWM is very overbought.

Hopefully that sets up for a legit three-day pure uptrend tuesday-thursday, just get the bull euphoria all out of the way before the september downtrend. The setup is absolutely there for every sector as long as retail earnings continue to be 'better-than feared'. looks like everything has one last move higher before the bounce in energy makes people realize the rally can't last.  

Fun time to make money if you have a little patience, just short/buy puts on XOM and QQQ for end of september. one or the other has to work. All calls til thursday this week.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-14 00:09:33 - Do you want to actually learn how to make money? Here's what you do, study cash covered puts. Learn how those work. Think of it as a limit order for something you want to buy. Do that for a couple of years. Start to branch out from there. I got into the market around 2005. Lost a ton of money in 2008. Didn't really do much until 2012. Started trading actively again around 2015 and didn't get really good at all of this until about 2016 with a lot of dedication. My average y/y return since 2016 is 24%, but with less volatility than the QQQ. 

Do I use options? All the time, do I ever buy options? Almost never

Right now QQQ is way disconnected from TLT, and usually this year that‚Äôs resulted in the big plunges.

It's a bunch of moronic snowflake green horn conspiracy minded rubes that fancy themselves to be investors.   The GameStop saga had some merit in Jan 2021.   DFV did a.phenomenal job of really doing TA of GME, chose a  taget of $40, and went to work.  He was right, somewhat legit, and made millions as did several thousand that rode his coat tails.  

The Jan 2021 action on GME created a whole army of people that convincec themselves that they hadn't missed out and it has spin into a giant conspiracy vortex which now insists that Management Consultants in lock step with hedge funds.have been deliberately driving these retail dogs into the ground.  Itbeyond absurd,  a pure pump and dump as there is no value in the companies to sustain the equity prices.  It is making a lot of bagholders and is quite entertaining.

This hype train will die out in 6 weeks, and then limbo, see AMC and GME, squeeze was squozen, thinking that GME will moon, at this point makes no sense.
I don't think it was squozen for BBBY yet.
I can see huge gains this week, with the hype train, I'm happy to see spike to 35 and get out in part, maybe 50 if we really fuck up the algorithms, as much fun as it is to see the candles, even DFV reduced his position. 
Cash is cash, buy SPY and Nasdaq til EOY, gamble with some, but not all your money.

EOY 50 USD is possible, but speculative as fuck!

Surely, I don't think we will see single digit price in this stock for a very long time, same with GME and AMC, gorrila is out the cage.

DD with my finest crayon's:

At the moment we are at 13 usd, valued 1 billion.
With 35usd per share, company valuation will be approx 3,2 billion dollars....
As it stands GME and AMC were squeezed to, at this moment, 12 billion in evaluation, and BBBY is just about 1 billion now, see my fucktard way of thinking?
I also refuse to believe that shorts learned their lesson, better yet, they're likely bullish to ride that wave for a week or two, and then they'll exit, which will cause some massive drops.

My valuation math is probably fucked, it's Saturday, so I ain't sober and I'm not doing maths for you, someone will comment below, correcting me.

So yes, I can believe that AMC and GME crowd will jump on the bandwagon and will push the valuation this high, purely out of the mechanism of the market, and to have another GME moment.

Purely momentum, I can see 35 EUR spike this week, and Friday with bunch of options expiring will be fun, for sure.

Mind you, week ago Monday bbby shot up 60% in a single day.
This play was still relatively under the radar for most, this has changed last week, when everyone noticed the spike and started paying attention.
Loads of calls were executed this Friday for strike price 10 - 10,50 
Seeing the posts here, there's a number of options that will expire on the 19th, for the same strike price.

__________________________","WSB - Posted @2022-08-13 23:47:19 - For sure. Lots of people don‚Äôt understand and I guess it was because they didn‚Äôt participate in the gme fiasco. 

I keep seeing posts about where it‚Äôs safe to hold the shares if they do the same thing and it blows my mind. It‚Äôs not the brokerage that holds the risk, it‚Äôs owning the shares. 

I personally don‚Äôt think anything even remotely similar to the gme squeeze is going to happen with bbby for a few reasons. The main one is that there hasn‚Äôt been any build up for it at all. All of this hype has come in over the last two weeks and that is nothing compared to the gme build up. The second is that there is no DFV!!! We literally lived to see his daily portfolio updates. Those updates gave people that had never even considered buying stock solid faith in the squeeze. That is just not present in this scenario. People will paper hand those shares at the first sign of trouble without a messiah. Might sound cliche, but I feel it is the truth. Third is that there is no villain. No Melvin Capitol. The powder keg isn‚Äôt there, the sense of team isn‚Äôt there, and there is no lit fuse. Not saying it won‚Äôt double again or even triple. I just don‚Äôt see it going past 50$ at all. If it does, the great mysterious ‚Äúthey‚Äù will stomp it out extra quick. 

Just my last two cents I have left after degenerately gambling my life savings on gme, dogecoin, and last but not least spy puts in a bull run. Take it for what you will.

Plus, there's a *reason* DFV didn't sell at $400, and there's a reason why GME insiders are buying shares with personal cash. It's because GME will eventually explode in value, beyond what we've seen thus far

WSB - Posted @2022-08-14 00:02:57 - Run it and best of luck to you! I would love to see it go alllllll the way to the moon. My only thing is that if it does start to go up, they will squash it. We saw shaaaaaaady stuff on gme though. If I recall correctly there was like a multi billion dollar loan from one fund to another to cover that massive short position, hedge funds literally bought trusted news reporters and went out of their way to tell lies on prime time tv, a ridiculous amount of bots and paid shills (in excess of a million) on this very forum attempting to spread misinformation and scare people out of buying and holding shares, and to top it off we even saw our United States congressmen (and women) eat lie after lie from the owners of hedge funds that had been accused of committing very very serious crimes against the American people (who elected them to defend us and take care of us) after swearing on a bible on live tv and pretend like they didn‚Äôt understand how the stock market works. 

Gme had a seemingly unstoppable amount of force and they stopped in its tracks, cut it into mince meat, and fed it to the dogs. I didn‚Äôt see ANY of these criminals go to jail or face any real consequences whatsoever. They made sure to dox DFV though, get him fired from his job, and he essentially had to go into hiding. 

It was atrocious to say the very least. I see no reason why this would play out any differently if it were to even begin to reach such proportions.

I just went and saw the original DFV video on GME on YouTube. It is a 54 min video, which is too long for 99.9 percent of the crowd here 

At around the 49 min mark he says he does not expect GameStop to be a short squeeze, it is a small chance but he was seeing it as a value play. 

He thought a company that is highly levered and shorted and on the verge of bankruptcy and then avoids it has a far higher chance of squeezing. 

He saw the future.....

The conditions of this new scenario as it pertains to WSB specifically are wayy different than the start of the GME scenario. People were clowning on DFV at the start. For month. They were not buying in en masse. If there is a critical mass point at all to the BBBY thing, it isn‚Äôt nearly as far away as GME was when GME began gaining momentum on this sub or is already passed.

Do you know how much retards loved gaming, felt nostalgia, hated how shorters tried to kill their childhood essentially? People genuinely wanted gamestop to bounce back and it was a perfect David VS Goliath with DFV holding the torch. 

BBBY has a different sentiment. Albeit, people still have a sense of comraderie in wanting to get rich and memes. RC is holding the torch here and this may very well be a different day, same old squeeze.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-16 23:01:14 - What a day 

A lot of people asked me for $$$ and advice - Offering neither.   Some thoughts on today from  a BaBBY whale.  

 1. Almost everyone asks about timing.  I understand.  However, it is certainly more important to be right than to be ‚Äúearly‚Äù.   No one can time every peak and valley perfectly.  Doing so is the easiest way for the HF‚Äôs to separate you from your tendies.   

2.  My opinion - BBBY is going up.  Substantially.  It won‚Äôt matter if you invested last week, yesterday, today or tomorrow.   This is a potentially life-changing money opportunity.   If you want to escape with your 6% gain as the short positions open near either bell, fine.  But this is wsb.   Go big or go back behind the dumpster.
3. You saw the short‚Äôs desperation on full display.  Not subtle in the least.  That gives me confidence.  And they STILL couldn‚Äôt wipe it past 30% even with the threat of  a literal nuclear disaster‚Ä¶
4. Bulls vs bears.  Just choose a side.  (Seriously you would take Loop? Lol) HF‚Äôs can trade earlier/later and faster and with more (unfair, sure) info.   They‚Äôre sharks and they will come for your stop limits.   The only thing they can‚Äôt do is literally compel you to sell.   They will threaten and scare, use dirty and psychological tricks and gimmicks just like a bully.  The only response is to stand up to them and not budge.   
5. They‚Ä¶ also don‚Äôt affect whales.  Whales are too big for sharks.  They just don‚Äôt care.  The whales are slow.  But they‚Äôre coming.  Lost in the roller coaster is that BBBY comfortably crossed the 1B market cap line.  That‚Äôs key.  If it stays there for a brief period, it‚Äôs lights out.  Period.  Tons of whales are prohibited (internally) from messing with small stuff below 1B.   
6. Speaking of slow, a LOT of calls are 1/23. Yes we have a big EOW coming up but this is not stopping anytime soon.  Strap in üöÄ
7. Volume.   Burying the lead here.  It was high.  Too high.   This stock can swing triple digit percents in hours.  Deduce what you will. 
8. And this is a big point - literally EVERYONE, shorts included, know what this stock can get to now( and exceed if the halters don‚Äôt try to bail them out), rapidly.    That smell you smell is not from an old towel in need of replacement at the local retailer.  It‚Äôs short dismay.  
9. Speaker of retailers, I know this is breaking news, but BBBY is a ‚Ä¶retailer.  Publicity good.  For retail investors and retail customers.  In ü¶ç: Free ad good.  Retail like.   
10. To tie in the BaBBY üê≥ thing - beyond everything else, this is a post-pandemic baby boom play.  Check with the local hospital.  There will be ‚Ä¶ a lot of babies this autumn.  
11. A lot of people said I should sell.  Same response to our dear hedgies - N.O. 

If you read this far, congrats.  You have literally lost IQ and you can‚Äôt spell YOLO without low iq.  

Finally, a lot of you are invoking DFV.  I am not in fact DFV.  He may always be in our hearts (or other regions), but identity theft is not a joke ! Millions of families suffer every year !

TLDR : üêª‚ùå   ü¶ç + üê≥üíéüíé = üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Target : whatever you‚Äôre imagining x 10
Positions : 170,000 shares, 200 1/23 10C.  Im still in.  All in

__________________________","WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 13:34:41 - The SEC *never* claimed the shorts didn't cover. You can say the SEC were wrong, you can claim they're corrupt, but you can't credibly claim that the SEC believes that the shorts didn't close.
  
  
""...particularly during the earlier rise from January 22 to 27 the price of GME rose as the short interest decreased. Staff also observed discrete periods of sharp price increases during which accounts held by firms known to the staff to be covering short interest in GME were actively buying large volumes of GME shares, in some cases accounting for very significant portions of the net buying pressure during a period...""
  
  
**The SEC is clearly convinced that the major short positions were closed in this period**

""...buy volume in GME, including buy volume from participants identified as having large short positions, increased significantly beginning around January 22 and remained high for several days, corresponding to the beginning of the most dramatic phase of the run-up in GME‚Äôs price.""
  
  
  
**Note that the volume selling by shorts is high at the *beginning*, before most apes really piled on. This is the period when DFV and the original WSB apes routed the hedge funds**
  
 
  
""Figure 6 shows that the run-up in GME stock price coincided with buying by those with short positions. However, it also shows that *such buying was a small fraction of overall buy volume*,""
  

  
**Apes love to seize on this line because to them it suggests that shorts weren't buying. In context, what it really means is that the shorts were largely finished buying by this point in the cycle, and apes were now bidding up the price *after* the squeeze.**

  
""...and that GME share prices continued to be high after the direct effects of covering short positions would have waned. The underlying motivation of such buy volume cannot be determined; perhaps it was motivated by the desire to maintain a short squeeze. Whether driven by a desire to squeeze short sellers and thus to profit from the resultant rise in price, or by belief in the fundamentals of GameStop, *it was the positive sentiment, not the buying-to cover*, that sustained the weeks-long price appreciation of GameStop stock."" 
  
  
**This is by far the most misunderstood passage ""not buying to cover"" isn't the same as ""shorts didn't cover"". What they are saying is that days and weeks after the squeeze, trapped shorts were no longer driving the volume/price action, retail investors were, at least in the view of the SEC.**

More worryingly, the most important figure in the whole trade is *selling*. Imagine if DFV announced he was going to sell on January 20th.

Also, RC‚Äôs filing *could* mean he is convinced that BBBY is going to sell a bunch of shares.

WSB - Posted @2022-08-18 04:20:25 - That‚Äôs definitely not true. WSB has been around before DFV even bought his first share of GME. 

But GME is a big part of this subs history and definitely changed things once enough people started looking at it regularly.
__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-18 04:14:56 - It is illegal for him and an obvious attempt to manipulate markets to file an intent to sell if he is not intending to sell‚Ä¶

‚ÄúThe party filing Form 144 must have a bona fide intention to sell the securities within a reasonable time frame after filling.‚Äù

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form144.asp

No matter what it‚Äôs a swing trade. He‚Äôs also well up on his options obviously... The three members he put on the board in March have done nothing to turn the company around, the company is in dire straights now and it will take many years for any decent change in strategy to come to fruition. 

But the funniest part is you saying Ryan Cohen is some philanthropist with his failure of Chewy and complete luck riding the coat tails of DFV and GME. Plans to turn the company digital and an NFT marketplace? That‚Äôs going really well‚Ä¶ LOL.

All I can say from the outside is right now the optics of the situation look very bad. Cohen never overtly said anything to WallStreetbets, this has all been conjectures based on his activities‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs really apes fucking themselves in the ass at this point not seeing the writing on the wall. 

He played it smart and got rich‚Ä¶ Again we can discuss intentions in perspectives but the optics here are millions of apes holding onto a dream of this being another GME‚Ä¶ and getting fucked. There‚Äôs something like 16 million shares shorted in BBBY by your guys claims. This is nothing like the Gamma squeeze presented and the once in a lifetime opportunity DFV identified because hedgies were using synthetic means to short shares that didn‚Äôt exist and were short more than the total float. 

What‚Äôs truly criminal is every post here comparing the situation to GME when again the short interest is so fucking far apart. 

Is it possible the apes can ban together here worldwide and take the stock for A for the ride? Sure anything is possible and I frankly wish it would happen‚Ä¶ But based on overall volume it doesn‚Äôt look like it will. 

There are times to hodl, this is not one of them. There has been no concrete information provided on this board why the company will succeed and have shareholder value further increase in the coming months beyond Cohen‚Äòs activities and ‚Äúgiving it to the shorts.‚Äù 20% short interest is not that big‚Ä¶ 

Cohen has filed to sell and if he doesn‚Äôt within 90 days it‚Äôs going to get very ugly for him. He will‚Ä¶ Not everybody can sell at the top and he is not dumb enough to let everybody sell before him. In the world of stocks it‚Äôs every man for himself. You don‚Äôt tell your friends when you‚Äôre going to sell and then everybody enters the order at the same time lol. There‚Äôs no magic buying hands that takes everybody shares at the top. 

So there‚Äôs only one scenario left and why Kramer is acting like a completed idiot going ape shit over it. I‚Äôm not sure why he‚Äôs acting like a baby and saying the gloating stupid things he is, but he is right in this situation. The writing is on the wall. The game is over.

üê≥üíé

Added 4,000 shares yesterday.  I‚Äôm holding 174,000 off the board.   I‚Äôm no DFV, but he held 200,000 GME at one point.  He‚Äôs The Godfather.  40k gain of the 2M came from him and GME.   

I‚Äôm asking him for a simple ‚ÄúI like the stock tweet.‚Äù For old time‚Äôs sake.  

I understand a fraction of the craziness he went through.  I can‚Äôt believe he did what he did for so long.  So even if he‚Äôs gone, we respect forever.  

But is is unreasonable, in this critical time, to stick it to the HF‚Äôs one last time?

You helped me make 40k on GME.  I‚Äôm going for 40M on BBBY.  You‚Äôre The Godfather and we all owe you.  

Is it impossible to stick it to the hedge funds one more time?

__________________________",,"WSB - Posted @2022-08-18 12:51:56 - Good point here. But the FTDs piling up, high short percentage, cost to borrow increasing, bullish retail sentiment and retail piling up is what makes me compare it to GME. 

I couldn't be mad at DFV for stating he wanted to sell. The name of the game is to make money and he made a killing. 

I just don't believe the squeeze is over just because it dipped 18% *after hours.* After 7 consecutive green day, of course a red day is coming and the volatility makes the swings really violent.

I seriously did the exact same thing only I did it with BTC in 2018-2021. Paid off all of my loans, my entire mortgage and have about 100K left over which I'm trading rather conservative.

__________________________",,"WSB - Posted @2022-08-12 22:24:59 - Ive a short position but I am also looking at BTC. If BTC goes above 25k, I‚Äôll be in trouble.
__________________________","WSB - Posted @2022-08-12 23:20:03 - I live in africa, and worked 10 years to have 60k.
I started with stock in 2021 , without option until i reached 63k.
Noob like me is happy to earn 3k by just investing in airlines.
3 months after, i moved to crypto , and then i did thz bigest mistake in my life. I started trading option without any knowledge.
So i shorted solana with 50X.
At that time , 1 solana = 47$.
I ignored that solana were about to launch NFT market, so it jumped from 47$ to 120.
And i lost everything.
4 months after, i saved 3k $ and i shorted BTC at 90X speed thinking that i can earn back what i lost.
So i lost everything again.
Then , i noticed that i am an asshole who can bet his life in features like the japaness anime ""kaije"".
So i worked hard in 2022 and i saved 13k again and i bought some stock that i failed (novavax, robinhood, Riot , and some other shit stock).
In june 15 , i lost 70$ of my monney because of recession.
But , 3 weeks before i sold EVERYTHING and played every little $ on AMC, and for the first time since months , i start seeing a green wallet.
Once AMC reached 22-23$ i sold everything and bought BBBY, 
In 2 weeks , my wallet jumped from 7k to 18k. And i am still holding since 43% of the float need to be bought back by shorters soon or later.
My target price is between 30$ and 40$.
Too simply never lose hope. One day you will get back what you lost.
I was stupide and dumb with 0 experience in trading and i did a lot of mistakes.

Other guy‚Äôs right about energy intensity and other than easily, swiftly, and cheaply sending money over the border there‚Äôs really not a whole lot to use BTC for. 

There‚Äôs a solid 3-4 other projects including ETH that have a lot more utility and enterprise adoption and will probably end up leading the market eventually. 

Think of it like stonks. At one point in time US Steel company was the most valuable company and long before that the Dutch East India company.  Now we have the likes of Apple and Saidi Aramco leading the market.

I think Corn will be similar with different projects taking over over time as needs change and innovation takes over.

I don't see a logical argument that this is sustainable. There's too much bad debt out there that simply needs to be wiped away somehow, not covered up with things like QE. 


Everyone is trading monopoly money. If we think for a second inflation fears have subsided, that's awfully short sighted. Simple economics demonstrates that countries with enormous debt loads will never pay them back with money valued anywhere near what it is today. Yes, I'm saying the 30 year T Bill is basically the worst among common investments. If a company had the financials of the US, along with a recent history of barely making good on payment dates, it would be junk status.

Yes maybe the company will go away in next 5-10 years and you could be right. But to short it so much it becomes illegal act and take on the giant risk ignoring retail can snuff you out? Welp your fundamental go out the window and this becomes a game of chicken on wall street. Shorts VS Longs. BBBY can be a benefactor when everything is said and done. Overall to just say ""no one should invest in it because your not doing it long term"" or ""i think the company can never recover so therefore dont invest for short term gains"" make sound like a dumb fucking virtue signaler.

__________________________
WSB - Posted @2022-08-14 00:42:24 - There isn‚Äôt a centralized Securities Lending market where rates are set and everyone pays the same. The rates are negotiated between the borrower/lender or based on a model if you‚Äôre selling another clients long. 

In reality the shares likely won‚Äôt even be borrowed until they are needed for settlement in T+2. That‚Äôs when shares / cash exchange hands. If your broker borrowed shares on T - they would be the ones funding it and paying the borrow cost. 

Given most trading is disclosed there is also a relationship aspect. Rates are generally sticky - that is existing shares are not rerated everyday. The rate you‚Äôre referencing is the cost to short an incremental share. Big funds with self clearing (internal PB) who short early may be paying 1% when market is 10 or 15% for example. They will also be last on the list to be recalled (forced to cover or borrow elsewhere). The reason being the relationship is viewed as a whole. Basically I say you‚Äôll lose out on a few hundred k in borrow fees, but the borrow will be stable and you‚Äôll make up for it in other ways (commissions, pb balances, etc). 

Retail obviously has differences in rerates and buy-ins. However IB‚Äôs view isn‚Äôt the whole market even for retail and certainly shouldn‚Äôt be used to read into what the borrow market looks like for institutions. IE: If Two Sigma, DE Shaw, Citadel or someone wanted to short a few million shares on Monday morning they would have no issue doing so. The fact retail can still short is the first indication of this. You can also back out borrow rates by looking at the synthetic equivalent in options.

__________________________",,,,,,"WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 05:07:46 - US Treasury market is truly interesting. Sure, there are investors and traders for profit or hedge as it being the riskfree investment. But only focusing on this is ignoring the elephant in the room. As dollar being the global reserved currency, foreign countries that do not have the ability to print usd are obligatrd to keep certain amount of foreign currency to prevent incident where they run out of dollar but need dollar to buy energy, and impact could be truly devastating compared to what americans have experienced, such as asian financial crisis in 98 and on-going incident at srilanka. 

The chance of foreign countries running out of dollar increases when dollar gets stronger. Foreign countries keep foreign reserve to be protected, which creates artificial demand in us treasury. For them, they dont give a fuck about yiels it provides, they need to have it for balancing the book. They will buy it at whatever the price if they need it, sell it at whatever the price if they dont need it. I remember glancing through a paper released by fed saying they buy bond when its expensive, sell when its cheap, true regards out of necessity. 

And US treasury is the most liquid market, so it works as a free market in action, amalgamation of decision making done by sovereign nations, individual investors, institutional investors, traders, and so on based on their individual assessment of current situation happing all simultaneously. FED only has ability to affect the short term interest rate, and long term is determined by market action. 

Yield curve should be gently sloping upward as maturity increases. Inversion is indicating that market is disagreeing with fed's action. I think a good question to ask is what will be the near term yield would be if fed didnt manipulate near term yield from agressive hiking? I bet near term yield would be much lower than what it is right now. 

Another question to be asked is who the fuck would buy 4 week T bill with 2.1-2.2 yield if FED offers 2.3% riskfree rate from overnight reverse repo operstions?

Go read candle reviews from the last year. BBBY will likely come back to the $30 price soon.

If there's an upside and you buy in early enough to gain something, then all of that is upside to me!üòÉ Like that's way i think somewhat,  

If i buy into smthn at like 30, then it rose to 40, $10 upside, right. May decide to sell at 35 or 37, maybe 38 or so. Maybe id watch it go down a few times prior to hitting 40, panic and sell it at $32.  I don't really use a system. A good system is the 20% system if ur looking around,  :).

But yea, no way to really, accurately answer unless you use a system like some percentage type system that  you follow to the T so to speak(to the numbers/percentages) 

I'm more or less just gun slinging here, hehe!üòâü§£, gun slingin & prayinüôèüòáüòÅ

So, i feel good once I'm a safe lil bit itm, like maybe 5 to 8% itm, then i start w the thoughts & making decisions about when to sell or keep smthn. So that's when i could answer more specificly. 

I guess right now with bbby i would keep buying at up to 26 to 36 right now. If i feel like some time it's going to 80, I'll keep buying up to 72, 73, 75 maybe, I'll squeeze anything out of a turnip! haha! Not ashamed!üòâ
__________________________",,"WSB - Posted @2022-08-17 02:35:25 - I appreciate you keeping some data on hand!

I went ahead and ran a T test on the two groups to check for statistically different deviation between the two provided samples. 

The result was: P= 0.58. 

What does that mean? These two samples are so like one another that you couldn't say with certainty which stonk was which for any given day. This implies the trajectory of BBBY will be the same, day by day, of GME through the projected period of time.

YTD,"WSB - Posted @2022-08-10 21:40:18 - I think the Fed members talking today and last week and saying that they're staying on their rate hike course despite the low CPI made the rally run a bit cold. There hasn't been much trading volume on these higher levels. I still think that the steam of the bear market rally is running out, but then again I've been bearish a while based on macros and been wrong for two months now. Still out of the market and just day trading, have made over a 5 percent comeback to my YTD in just two weeks, but I put in the time for it too while day trading I guess.

I need to check out VOLDSPD and VOLD, I'm currently checking out indicators to help me in my day trading. Using price volume, and a guy recommended On-Balance Volume for longer trends today so a lot to learn. I guess there's a lot of stuff you can dig into to help for your day trading, I'm just a newbie but at least I'm making a profit I guess.

The score so far: üêª 85-69 üêÆ (nice)

Counting >1% movements: üêª 37-38 üêÆ (bulls ahead!!!)

Counting >2% movements: üêª 14-15 üêÆ (bulls ahead!!!)

Months: üêª 4-2 üêÆ (May was flat)

Weeks: üêª 19-13 üêÆ 

Last 4 weeks: üêª 0-4 üêÆ (a first this year)

SPY made 68 new highs last year vs. 1 this year so far. 97 trading days left to go in 2022. Stay tuned for tomorrow's episode of Bulls vs. Bears to see who is fuk tomorrow.

Fun fact: This is the first time we had 4 green weeks in a row since October (10 months ago).

Fun fact 2: We haven't had a -1% day since July 15th and we haven't had a -2% day since June 28th.

Fun fact 3: We've had 7 red days in the last 10 days but SPY still climbed nearly 4% during this time.

Because you legally need to hold the stocks you got for at least 6 months you are not going to see thousands of 144 filings. 

[https://sec.report/Form/144-PAPER](https://sec.report/Form/144-PAPER)

Amazon had 4 144 filing YTD  

EA had 12 filings YTD

Alphabet (Google) had 10 YTD

Form 144 filings are pretty normal. Everyone here are in it for the squeeze if it go up to $60 in a 2 weeks will you sell. Damn right you will. And that is exactly what the RC 144 is about. Just the right to sell nothing more nothing less.

[‚Ä¶] 

I‚Äôd now like to ask Rusty Schundler, our General Counsel, that you‚Äôve never seen our legal case to summarize our key legal advances in just this past quarter. Rusty?

Rusty Schundler

Thanks, Roger. We have recently taken two major steps toward resolving the outstanding claims brought by United Therapeutics. First, we have submitted all post-trial briefings in our Hatch-Waxman litigation in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.

As previously disclosed, trial was completed at the end of March. Thus with the submission of all post-trial briefings, the court now has all of the material required to reach a decision on the alleged infringement of the API manufacturing patent, which we refer to as the 066 patent and the method of use pen, which we refer to as the 793 patent.

The trial materials and transcripts are available from the court and we believe demonstrate all claims asserted are invalid and/or not infringed. We do not know when Judge Andrews will issue its ruling, but do expect that it will come before the end of October when the regulatory date expires.

Second, we have successfully concluded the inter partes review of the 793 patent with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board or PTAB, ruling in July that all claims are unpatentable. The PTABs ruling is not binding on the court and the Hatch-Waxman litigation and would not override an order of the court that the -- that YUTREPIA may not be approved due to infringement of the 793 patent unless and until the decision of the PTAB is affirmed on appeal.

However, coupled with United Therapeutics prior stipulation of partial judgment in favor of Liquidia with respect to the 901 patent, another patent that was initially asserted against Liquidia, the PTAB‚Äôs ruling means that even before the decision in the Hatch-Waxman litigation, Liquidia has now received favorable rulings with respect to two of the three patents initially asserted by United Therapeutics against Liquidia. We will continue to keep you updated on any material developments as we approach the court‚Äôs decision.

FAQ:

Serge Belanger

Hi. Good morning. A couple of questions on the ongoing legal proceedings, first on the timing of the District Court decision, just curious, I think, there was a recent post-trial briefing demanded by the District Court judge, curious if that potentially portends in earlier decisions then October? And then, secondly, maybe just talk about how different the 066 patent that remains at issue in the District Court litigation, how it differs to 901 and 793? Thanks.

Roger Jeffs

Yeah. Thank you. Thanks for the question, Serge. Rusty, I‚Äôll ask you to address those please.

Rusty Schundler

Thanks, Serge. So, on your first question, regarding the timing of District Court decisions, it‚Äôs hard to predict when the courts can rule. You‚Äôre correct that the court did ask for some supplemental briefing. I think it was in July. But that does not necessarily mean that the decision will come earlier. Again, we think it‚Äôll be before the end of the 30 months day at the end of October, but beyond that, could theoretically be any day. So, again, it‚Äôs just hard to predict, because the courts are busy and they have a lot of competing demands on their time.

On the second question, on the differences between 066 patent and the 901 and 793. The 066 and 901 are both methods of manufacturing the treprostinil API. The 793 patent is a method of treatment patents. So the 793 patents quite a bit different from the 066 and 901 patents.

The 066 and 901 patents are very similar as to what they cover, but the language of the claims is different. And so, if you look at the claim construction and what that meant, as far as what the 901 patent covered versus the 066, there are some differences. So I‚Äôm not sure if that answers your question, but they do cover very similar things. But, again, there‚Äôs some key differences in the way the claims were structured in those two patents.

__________________________",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"WSB - Posted @2022-08-15 22:01:01 - Tried to DM you but couldn‚Äôt- here‚Äôs what I wrote up:




disclaimer: I interviewed mid 2020 so everything was remote- not sure if that makes a huge difference.

first round (post recruiter) was an online leet code style test using their system. it‚Äôs has test cases so you need to get the answers correct - they were two medium leet codes. wasn‚Äôt too bad but have a side laptop for lookup as they detect mouse movement. Get both correct, this is the candidate filter system.

on-site had two leet codes but they didn‚Äôt use the program - you need more than pseudo code but don‚Äôt worry about language specifics. one was medium LRU cache, the other was some tricky hard string question I solved but couldn‚Äôt optimize for.

they put a big emphasis on the STAR approach for soft skills. Study it well and pre-prepare two examples for each. They will ask this every time you interview with someone. Keep it work related, try not to make it up since they will have follow up questions

besides STAR the other place to really shine is the system design. I interviewed for the Alexa team and they asked me an IoT question for designing a smart lock that provides notifications for low battery. They keep it very open ended so make sure to practice. Ask questions, think big picture and consider more than just API design: ex. ‚Äúkeep the battery readings in buffered memory and post occasionally to avoid heavy traffic/protect for network issues‚Äù or ‚Äúuse an API to queue the messages and lambda to update db so we don‚Äôt lose data/stall clients/can easily aggregate‚Äù 

They gave me an offer within a week. You need to be confortabile with LC medium and passable with hard. Big points for STAR and system design questions. 

Most people can pass the LCs with practice, where you stand out is the other two.

Example: A and B are shitbag terrorists/russian oligarchs/human traffickers, etc. and any money they move directly is likely to be detected or intercepted.

Item of value, in this case shares traded on an exchange is used to transfer value between the parties instead.

Party A buys shares for $x from a third party who is uninvolved for fair value. Party B loads up the order book with bids for $x+a shitload. Party A sells the shares to Party B at the inflated price. Volume is so low that the market makers match these two together.

Poof, you just transferred money from Party B to Party A and it looks like short term investing profit. The shares are worthless or inconsequential to the transaction, they never wanted them in the first place.

You can also do it other way around by selling something below ifs fair value and letting the recipient have it and then sell it at fair value. This is extremely common in art auctions, real estate, counterfeit goods trafficking, etc.

Bed Bath and Beyond is shorted to oblivion like GameStop was (is), and the people who did the shorting are finding themselves even more underwater this time.

So the bad guys (short hedge funds) used mass media to bring attention to the stock along with GameStop and AMC, and today, after hours when retail trader where out of the game, they shorted all three into the ground. 

So now they have survived another day but they are deeper underwater, and they can only kick the can so far.

And that's not even the tip of the iceberg. All because a bunch of degenerates outsmarted wall street and are putting a wedge between the criminals and their criminal means.
